abstract = {For a detailed study of the accuracy of the Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP all expected sources of uncertainty were investigated with respect to their contributions to the uncertainty of the final result. In the course of these investigations, cross-reference measurements with singly charged carbon clusters 12C+n were carried out. The carbon cluster ions were produced by use of laser-induced desorption, fragmentation, and ionization of C60 fullerenes and injected into and stored in the Penning trap system. The comparison of the cyclotron frequencies of different carbon clusters has provided detailed insight into the residual systematic uncertainty of ISOLTRAP and yielded a value of 8×10-9. This also represents the current limit of mass accuracy of the apparatus. Since the unified atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 of the mass of the 12C atom, it will be possible to carry out absolute mass measurements with ISOLTRAP in the future.},

The work focuses on the interconversion of the magnetron and cyclotron motional modes, in particular the modification of the resonance profiles for quadrupolar excitation due to the damping effect of the residual gas. Extensive experiments have been performed with standard and Ramsey excitation schemes. The results are in good agreement with predictions obtained by analytical continuation of the formulae for the undamped case. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {One of the necessary experimental quantities required for the test of unitarity of the fundamental Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix can be gained from nuclear beta decay. However, the short-lived beta-decaying nuclei have to be produced on-line in order to provide a large enough sample to carry out the experiments. At the new ISAC (Isotope Separator and Accelerator) facility at the TRIUMF national laboratory in Vancouver, Canada, ideal conditions are provided for the production of some of the most interesting nuclides in that respect. The experimental information that is needed are branching ratio, half-life and Q-value of the specific beta decay. For the first two components experiments have already been carried out or are in preparation at ISAC (Ball et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 (2001) 1454, and experiments E823 and E909 approved at TRIUMF), for the third one, we are proposing to set up a unique facility capable of high accuracy mass measurements $\delta$m/m ≤ 1 × 10-8 on very short-lived isotopes (T1/2 ≤ 50 ms) employing a Penning trap spectrometer coupled to an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) for charge breeding. The main goal of TITAN is mass measurements, however, the unique combination of the systems will allow to carry out high precision measurements in other fields of nuclear and also atomic physics. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Among the various processes responsible for the formation of the heavy elements in stars, the slow neutron capture process (s-process) is distinguished by the fact that it involves mostly stable isotopes. Therefore, the relevant nuclear physics data can be determined by experiments. With this rather reliable data basis, s-process nucleosynthesis offers an important testground of models for the late stages of stellar evolution, which are supposed to be the s-process site. The empirical counterpart for such models is the so-called classical s-process, a purely phenomenological picture, that is successfully used to derive the resulting abundances as well as information on the physical conditions during the s-process. The status of this classical approach is reviewed with emphasis on the implications for various stellar models of the s-process and in the light of results obtained by stellar spectroscopy. A brief account of the potential s-process chronometers is also presented.},

abstract = {The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) encounters unstable nuclei far from $\beta$-stability. Therefore its observable features, like the abundances, witness (still uncertain) nuclear structure as well as the conditions in the appropriate astrophysical environment. With the remaining lack of a full understanding of its astrophysical origin, parameterized calculations are still needed. We consider two approaches: (1) the classical approach is based on (constant) neutron number densities nn and temperatures T over duration timescales $\tau$; (2) recent investigations, motivated by the neutrino wind scenario from hot neutron stars after a supernova explosion, followed the expansion of matter with initial entropies S and electron fractions Ye over expansion timescales $\tau$. In the latter case the freezeout of reactions with declining temperatures and densities can be taken into account explicitly. We compare the similarities and differences between the two approaches with respect to resulting abundance features and their relation to solar r-process abundances, applying for the first time different nuclear mass models in entropy-based calculations. Special emphasis is given to the questions of (a) whether the same nuclear properties far from stability lead to similar abundance patterns and possible deficiencies in (1) and (2), and (b) whether some features can also provide clear constraints on the astrophysical conditions in terms of permitted entropies, Ye values, and expansion timescales in (2). This relates mostly to the A {\textless} 110 mass range, where a fit to solar r-abundances in high-entropy supernova scenarios seems to be hard to attain. Possible low-entropy alternatives are presented.},

abstract = {Recently improved information on the stellar (n, $\gamma$) cross sections of neutron magic nuclei at N=82, and in particular of 142Nd, turn out to represent a sensitive test for models of s-process nucleosynthesis. While these data were found to be incompatible with the classical approach based on an exponential distribution of neutron exposures, they provide significantly better agreement between the solar abundance distribution of s nuclei and the predictions of models for low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The origin of this phenomenon is identified as lying in the high neutron exposures at low neutron density obtained between thermal pulses when 13C burns radiatively in a narrow layer of a few 10-4 Msolar. This effect is studied in some detail, and the influence of the currently available nuclear physics data is discussed with respect to specific further questions. In this context, particular attention is paid to a consistent description of s-process branchings in the region of the rare earth elements. It is shown that, in certain cases, the nuclear data are sufficiently accurate that the resulting abundance uncertainties can be completely attributed to stellar modeling. Thus, the s-process becomes important for testing the role of different stellar masses and metallicities as well as for constraining the assumptions used in describing the low neutron density provided by the 13C source.},

The parameters expected in experiments of antiproton cooling by electrons are assumed. The relaxation of antiproton energy is followed by the rate equation with proper account taken into account for the slow transfer of energy between parallel and perpendicular components of strongly magnetized electrons. The equilibrium distribution of each species are obtained by molecular dynamics simulations for various values of parameters and the results are reproduced by theoretical calculations to a good accuracy. The condition for the centrifugal separation is obtained.},

abstract = {The recoil-$\beta$ tagging technique was used to identify transitions associated with the decay of the 2+ and, tentatively, the 4+ excited states in Sr74. Combining these results with published data for the A=74 isobars, triplet energy differences (TEDs) have been extracted, the heaviest case for which these values have been evaluated. State-of-the-art shell-model calculations using the JUN45 interaction and incorporating a J=0 isospin nonconserving (INC) interaction with an isotensor strength of 100 keV can reproduce the trend in the TED data, with particularly good agreement for the 2+ state. This agreement for the TED data taken together with the fact that agreement has also been shown between shell-model calculations with the same strength of INC interaction in the f7/2 shell and recently for A=66 strongly suggests that such an interaction exists throughout the nuclear chart and cannot have a strong dependence on details of nuclear structure such as which nuclear orbitals are occupied. It also supports the hypothesis that only a J=0 component of the INC interaction need be included to explain the observed TEDs.},

It consists of a gas-filled, segmented, linear Paul trap and is the first stage of the TITAN setup with the purpose of cooling and bunching radioactive ion beams delivered from ISAC-TRIUMF. This is the first such device to be driven digitally, i.e., using a high voltage (V pp=400V), wide bandwidth (0.2{\textless}f {\textless}1.2MHz) square-wave as compared to the typical sinusoidal wave form. Results from the commissioning of the device as well as systematic studies with stable and radioactive ions are presented including efficiency measurements with stable 133Cs and radioactive 124,126Cs.

abstract = {The ??-decay of 20Mg was investigated. A secondary beam of 20Mg ions, produced in reactions between a 95 A??MeV24Mg-beam and a natNi-target, was isotopically separated by means of the LISE3 spectrometer at GANIL. This secondary beam was implanted into a silicon detector array surrounded by germanium ??-detectors. The ??-delayed proton and ??-ray data, measured for this short-lived nucleus (T1 2 = 95 ?? 3 ms), were incorporated into an improved 20Mg???20Na decay scheme. The 2645 keV level in 20Na is of importance for the breakout from the astrophysical hot CNO-cycle and the onset of the rapid proton capture process via the reaction 19Ne(p,??)20Na. An upper limit of 0.1{\%} for the ??-decay feeding of the 2645 keV level and a lower limit for the corresponding log ft value of 6.24 were determined. The implications of this result for the spin and parity assignment of the 2645 keV state are discussed. By comparing the 20Mg ??-decay into the proton-unbound 3001 keV state in 20Na and the isospin-mirrored decay into the particle-bound 3488 keV level in 20F, an asymmetry ft+ ft- - 1 = 1.69-0.65+0.86 was observed. The comparison of the experimentally determined B(GT) values for the Gamow-Teller ??-decay of 20Mg with a calculation performed in a full sd-shell model space yields an overall quenching of the Gamow-Teller strength of 0.84, corresponding to an observed fraction of 71{\%} of the calculated strength. The measured Gamow-Teller strength above excitation energies of 3 MeV is more fragmented than predicted by the shell-model calculation. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Peak-shape distortions and peak-splitting are commonly observed phenomena with all members of the quadrupole family of mass spectrometers. Errors in electrode shape, or spacing, or harmonies in the r.f. field may produce non-linear resonances. The resonances result in peak splitting by causing some ion trajectories to become unstable that otherwise, in a perfect field, would be stable and limited in amplitude. A theory of non-linear resonances in quadrupole fields was applied to the three-dimensional rotationally symmetric quadrupole ion trap to predict resonance locations in the Mathieu stability diagram. Numerical computation of trajectories was used to derive peak shapes for various amounts of distortion and to determine the extent of peak-splitting. The calculations were used to relate the performance to the spacing errors in assembling the electrode structure. The occurrence of resonances, in agreement with this theory, was experimentally demonstrated. A method is presented for obtaining good peak shapes in spite of the presence of field distortions, but with some loss in sensitivity. This method was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.},

This Colloquium aims to (1) give an historical overview of the major instrumentation achievements that have driven mass spectrometry forward in the past century, including those leading up to the initial work of Thomson, (2) provide the nonspecialist with an introduction to MS, and (3) highlight some key applications of MS and explore the current and future trends. Because of the vastness of the subject area and quality of the manifold research efforts that have been undertaken over the last 100 years, which have contributed to the foundations and subsequent advances in mass spectrometry, it should be understood that not all of the key contributions may have been included in this Colloquium. Mass spectrometry has embraced a multitude of scientific disciplines and to recognize all of the achievements is an impossible task, such has been the diverse impact of this invaluable technique.

The present weighted mean half-life value of (2.60±0.05)×106 yr substantially improves the reliability as an important chronometer for astrophysical applications in the million-year time range.

All nuclides for which any experimental information is known were considered. NUBASE2016 covers all data published by October 2016 in primary (journal articles) and secondary (mainly laboratory reports and conference proceedings) references, together with the corresponding bibliographical information. During the development of NUBASE2016, the data available in the 'Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File' (ENSDF) database were consulted and critically assessed for their validity and completeness. Furthermore, a large amount of new data and some older experimental results that were missing from ENSDF were compiled, evaluated and included in NUBASE2016. The atomic mass values were taken from the 'Atomic Mass Evaluation' (AME2016, second and third parts of the present issue). In cases where no experimental data were available for a particular nuclide, trends in the behavior of specific properties in neighboring nuclides (TNN) were examined. This approach allowed to estimate values for a range of properties that are labeled in NUBASE2016 as 'non-experimental' (flagged '{\#}'). Evaluation procedures and policies used during the development of this database are presented, together with a detailed table of recommended values and their uncertainties.},

It is designed to decelerate a beam of A/q {\textless} 3 particles with an energy of 4 MeV per nucleon as provided by the heavy ion storage ring ESR. HITRAP's decelerating linear accelerator (linac) will decelerate ions down to 6 keV per nucleon and then inject them into a Penning trap for cooling. The trap will capture bunches of up to 105 ions as heavy as U92+ in flight, cool and store them. After extraction from the cooler trap, the vertical beam line (VBL) transports the cold ions to the experiments. The linac has shown to decelerate ions down to 500 keV per nucleon on-line and to 6 keV per nucleon off-line. Recent tests with electrons and ions injected into the trap showed the necessity of a more careful electric and magnetic field alignment. An installed test ion source as well as a system of apertures and position sensitive diagnostics will be used to align the fields. A highly charged ion beam from a small room temperature electron beam ion trap was used for commissioning the VBL.},

Precise knowledge of the paths and final abundances of these two processes has been limited by the corresponding lack of precision in the proton-separation energies Sp when derived from extrapolated masses. The masses of 18 neutron-deficient isotopes of Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, and Rh have been measured using the Canadian Penning trap mass spectrometer. Three of the masses presented, 90Mo, 91Mo, and 93Tc, provide the first direct measurement of the masses of these nuclides, and the others provide confirmation of recent measurements using other Penning traps. Included in this work is a measurement of the mass of 87Mo, which differs by 3.7$\sigma$ from the mass presented in the 2003 Atomic Mass Evaluation. This leads to a change in the Sp value of 88Tc which reduces the suppression of flow of the $\nu$p-process path through 87Mo(p,$\gamma$)88Tc reported following the mass measurement of 88Tc [ C.

@article{Goriely2011a,
abstract = {Context. The rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, is known to be fundamental for explaining the origin of approximately half of the A {\textgreater} 60 stable nuclei observed in nature. In recent years nuclear astrophysicists have developed more and more sophisticated r-process models, by adding new astrophysical or nuclear physics ingredients to explain the solar system composition in a satisfactory way. Despite these efforts, the astrophysical site of the r-process remains unidentified. Aims. The composition of the neutron star outer crust material is investigated after the decompression that follows its possible ejection. Methods. The composition of the outer crust of a neutron star is estimated before and after decompression. Two different possible initial conditions are considered, namely an idealized crust composed of cold catalyzed matter and a crust initially in nuclear statistical equilibrium at temperatures around 1010 K. Results. We show that in this second case before decompression and at temperatures typically corresponding to 8 × 109 K, the Coulomb effect owing to the high densities in the crust leads to an overall composition of the outer crust in neutron-rich nuclei with a mass distribution close to the solar system r-abundance distribution. Such distributions differ, however, from the solar one due to a systematic shift in the second peak to lower values. After decompression, the capture of the few neutrons per seed nucleus available in the hot outer crust leads to a final distribution of stable neutron-rich nuclei with a mass distribution of 80 ≤ A ≤ 140 nuclei in excellent agreement with the solar distribution, provided the outer crust is initially at temperatures around 8 × 109 K and all layers of the outer crust are ejected. Conclusions. The decompression of the neutron star matter from the outer crust provides suitable conditions for a robust r-processing of the light species, i.e., r-nuclei with A ≤ 140. The final composition should carry the imprint of the temperature at which the nuclear statistical equilibrium is frozen prior to the ejection.},

abstract = {We present a first direct Q-value measurement of the Ga71($\nu$,e-)Ge71 reaction using the TITAN mass-measurement facility at ISAC/TRIUMF. The measurements were performed in a Penning trap on neon-like 71Ga21+ and 71Ge22+ using isobar separation of the on-line produced mother and daughter nuclei through threshold charge breeding in an electron-beam ion trap. In addition, isoionic samples of 71Ga21+ and 71Ge21+ were stored concurrently in the Penning trap and provided a separate Q-value measurement. Both independent measurements result in a combined Q-value of 233.5 ± 1.2 keV, which is in agreement with the previously accepted Q-value for the $\nu$ cross-section calculations. Together with a recent measurement of the $\nu$-response from the excited states in 71Ge, we conclude that there are no further uncertainties in the nuclear structure, which could remove the persistent discrepancy between the SAGE and GALLEX calibration measurements performed with neutrinos from reactor-produced 51Cr and 37Ar sources and the theoretical expectation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

At these facilities, many activities such as re-acceleration, improvement of resolving power, and preci- sion experimental measurements require charge breeding of ions. However, the charge breeding process can increase the energy spread of an ion bunch, adversely affecting the exper- iment. A Cooler Penning Trap (CPET) is being developed to address such an energy spread by means of sympathetic electron cooling of the Highly Charged Ion bunches to ? 1 eV/q. Recent work has focused on developing a strategy to effectively detect the trapped electron plasma without ob- structing the passage of ions through the beamline. The first offline tests demonstrate the ability to trap and detect more than 108 electrons. This was achieved by using a novel wire mesh detector as a diagnostic tool for the electrons.},

Masses of 104,105Zr and 109,110Mo are measured for the first time. Our improved results indicate significant deviations from the previously published values deduced from beta end point measurements. The most neutron-rich studied isotopes are found to be significantly less bound (1 MeV) compared to the 2003 atomic mass evaluation. A strong correlation between nuclear deformation and the binding energy is observed in the two-neutron separation energy in all studied isotope chains.},

abstract = {In this report we provide an overview of the open source Armadillo C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths). The library aims to have a good balance between speed and ease of use, and is useful if C++ is the language of choice (due to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another language like Matlab or Octave. In particular, Armadillo can be used for fast prototyping and computationally intensive experiments, while at the same time allowing for relatively painless transition of research code into production environments. It is distributed under a license that is applicable in both open source and proprietary software development contexts. The library supports integer, floating point and complex numbers, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration with LAPACK, or one its high-performance drop-in replacements, such as MKL from Intel or ACML from AMD. A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporaries. This is accomplished through C++ template meta-programming. Performance comparisons suggest that the library is considerably faster than Matlab and Octave, as well as previous C++ libraries such as IT++ and Newmat.},

@article{Papuga2014,
abstract = {Background: Ground-state spins and magnetic moments are sensitive to the nuclear wave function, thus they are powerful probes to study the nuclear structure of isotopes far from stability. Purpose: Extend our knowledge about the evolution of the 1/2+ and 3/2+ states for K isotopes beyond the N=28 shell gap. Method: High-resolution collinear laser spectroscopy on bunched atomic beams. Results: From measured hyperfine structure spectra of K isotopes, nuclear spins, and magnetic moments of the ground states were obtained for isotopes from N=19 up to N=32. In order to draw conclusions about the composition of the wave functions and the occupation of the levels, the experimental data were compared to shell-model calculations using SDPF-NR and SDPF-U effective interactions. In addition, a detailed discussion about the evolution of the gap between proton 1d3/2 and 2s1/2 in the shell model and ab initio framework is also presented. Conclusions: The dominant component of the wave function for the odd-A isotopes up to 45K is a $\pi$1d−13/2 hole. For 47,49K, the main component originates from a $\pi$2s−11/2 hole configuration and it inverts back to the $\pi$1d−13/2 in 51K. For all even-A isotopes, the dominant configuration arises from a $\pi$1d−13/2 hole coupled to a neutron in the $\nu$1f7/2 or $\nu$2p3/2 orbitals. Only for 48K, a significant amount of mixing with $\pi$2s−11/2⊗$\nu$(pf) is observed leading to a I$\pi$=1− ground state. For 50K, the ground-state spin-parity is 0− with leading configuration $\pi$1d−13/2⊗$\nu$2p−13/2.},

The 130Te Q value was found to be 2527.01(32) keV which is 3.3 keV lower than the 2003 Atomic Mass Evaluation recommended value, but in agreement with the most precise previous measurement. The uncertainty has been reduced by a factor of 6 and is now significantly smaller than the resolution achieved or foreseen in experimental searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay. The 128Te and 120Te Q values were found to be 865.87(131) keV and 1714.81(125) keV, respectively. For 120Te, this reduction in uncertainty of nearly a factor of 8 opens up the possibility of using this isotope for sensitive searches for neutrinoless double-electron capture and electron capture with positron emission.},

A recent study incorporating this $\nu$p process has indicated that the proton separation energy Sp of 93Rh is especially important in determining the relative production of these two isotopes. To reproduce the observed solar 92Mo/94Mo abundance ratio of 1.57 a Sp value for 93Rh of 1.64±0.1 MeV is required. The previously unknown masses of 92Ru and 93Rh have been measured with the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer resulting in an experimental value for Sp(93Rh) of 2.007±0.009 MeV.

Unfortunately, the rate of this reaction is essentially unconstrained experimentally, because the strengths of key S31 proton capture resonance states are not known, largely due to uncertainties in their spins and parities. Using the $\beta$ decay of Cl31, we have observed the $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ decay of a S31 state at Ex=6390.2(7) keV, with a P30(p,$\gamma$)S31 resonance energy of Er=259.3(8) keV, in the middle of the P30(p,$\gamma$)S31 Gamow window for peak nova temperatures. This state exhibits isospin mixing with the nearby isobaric analog state at Ex=6279.0(6) keV, giving it an unambiguous spin and parity of 3/2+ and making it an important l=0 resonance for proton capture on P30.},

abstract = {A technique for measuring mass differences has been developed at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) that requires no specialized equipment. Mass differences are measured as position differences between known and unknown-mass isobars, dispersed at the image of the energy-analyzing magnet following the 25 MV tandem post-accelerator, and identified by an energy-loss measurement. The technique has been demonstrated on neutron-rich 77–79Cu and 83–86Ge isotopes produced using the isotope separator online (ISOL) method with the 238U(p,fission) reaction, where a mass accuracy of 500 keV was achieved. These nuclides are well suited to the measurement technique, as they readily migrate out of the production target and to the ion source and comprise the most neutron-rich elements of the isobarically mixed beam. Because modest precision mass values can be obtained with only a few tens of counts of the nuclide of interest among orders of magnitude more of the isobaric neighbors closer to stability, the sensitivity of this technique makes it appropriate for initial mass measurements far from stability.},

Therefore, highly selective ion sources are essential. This article presents the development and successful on-line operation of an ion guide laser ion source (IG-LIS) for the production of ion beams free of isobaric contamination. Thermionic ions from the hot ISOL target are suppressed by an electrostatic potential barrier, while neutral radio nuclides effusing out are resonantly ionized by laser radiation within a quadrupole ion guide behind this barrier. The IG-LIS was developed through detailed thermal and ion optics simulation studies and off-line tests with stable isotopes. In a first on-line run with a SiC target a suppression of surface-ionized Na contaminants in the ion beam of up to six orders of magnitude was demonstrated.},

abstract = {With the advent of new wide-field, high-cadence optical transient surveys, our understanding of the diversity of core-collapse supernovae has grown tremendously in the last decade. However, the pre-supernova evolution of massive stars, which sets the physical backdrop to these violent events, is theoretically not well understood and difficult to probe observationally. Here we report the discovery of the supernova iPTF 13dqy = SN 2013fs a mere {\~{}}3 h after explosion. Our rapid follow-up observations, which include multiwavelength photometry and extremely early (beginning at {\~{}}6 h post-explosion) spectra, map the distribution of material in the immediate environment (≲1015 cm) of the exploding star and establish that it was surrounded by circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected during the final {\~{}}1 yr prior to explosion at a high rate, around 10−3 solar masses per year. The complete disappearance of flash-ionized emission lines within the first several days requires that the dense CSM be confined to within ≲1015 cm, consistent with radio non-detections at 70–100 days. The observations indicate that iPTF 13dqy was a regular type II supernova; thus, the finding that the probable red supergiant progenitor of this common explosion ejected material at a highly elevated rate just prior to its demise suggests that pre-supernova instabilities may be common among exploding massive stars.},

abstract = {Bradbury Nielsen gates are well known devices used to switch ion beams and are typically applied in mass or mobility spectrometers for separating beam constituents by their different flight or drift times. A Bradbury Nielsen gate consists of two interleaved sets of electrodes. If two voltages of the same amplitude but opposite polarity are applied the gate is closed, and for identical (zero) potential the gate is open. Whereas former realizations of the device employ actual wires resulting in difficulties with winding, fixing and tensioning them, our approach is to use two grids photo-etched from a metallic foil. This design allows for simplified construction of gates covering large beam sizes up to at least 900 mm 2 with variable wire spacing down to 250 $\mu$m. By changing the grids the wire spacing can be varied easily. A gate of this design was installed and systematically tested at TRIUMF's ion trap facility, TITAN, for use with radioactive beams to separate ions with different mass-to-charge ratios by their time-of-flight. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, masses of even rather exotic nuclei can be measured very precisely employing Penning-trap mass spectrometry. With the JYFLTRAP Penning trap at the IGISOL facility, masses of around 100 neutron-deficient nuclei have been determined with a typical precision of a few keV. Most recently, 25Al, 30P, 31Cl, and 52Co have been measured. Of these, the precision of the mass-excess value of 31Cl was improved from 50 to 3.4 keV, and the mass of 52Co was experimentally determined for the first time. The mass of 31Cl is relevant for estimating the waiting-point conditions for 30S as the 31Cl($\gamma$, p)30S–30S(p, $\gamma$)31Cl equilibrium ratio depends exponentially on the Q value. For 52Co, located at the path towards 56Ni, a deviation from the extrapolated mass value has been revealed. In this contribution, recent JYFLTRAP experiments for the rp process will be discussed.},

abstract = {Previous computations of ion trajectories in the monopole mass spectrometer [P. H. Dawson and N. P. Whetten, Rev. Sci. Instr. 39, 1417 (1968)], for ion injection parallel to the instrument axis, have predicted asymmetric peaks with a tail on the low mass side and only 40{\%} ion transmission. This is because an off-axis object cannot be completely focused at the exit from the analyzer. It is shown here that superior focusing at the analyzer exit, leading to symmetrical peaks, 100{\%} ion transmission and, in some conditions, a reduction in the necessary rod-Vee Block spacing, and therefore in rf power, can be obtained by proper use of a fringing field at the monopole entrance. A simple linear entrance ramp, where ion trajectories are mathematically unstable, and which is apparently harmful to the quadrupole mass filter [W. M. Brubaker, Advan. Mass Spectry. 4, 293 (1967)], can be beneficial in the monopole. Examples of computed ion trajectories and peak shapes are given and various entrance ramps are compared. The chance use of an entrance ramp probably explains some of the high performance monopoles that have been constructed.},

We explore fission cycling and steady $\beta$ flow as the driving mechanisms behind this feature. The presence of fission cycling during the r process can account for nucleosynthesis yields between the second and third peaks, whereas the presence of steady $\beta$ flow can account for consistent r-process patterns, robust under small variations in astrophysical conditions. We employ the neutrino-driven wind of the core-collapse supernova to examine fission cycling and steady $\beta$ flow in the r process.

abstract = {Measurements of the atomic mass further our understanding in many disciplines from metrology to physics beyond the standard model. The accuracy and precision of Penning trap mass spectrometry have been well demonstrated at TITAN, including measurements of neutron-rich calcium and potassium isotopes to investigate three-body forces in nuclear structure and within the island of inversion to study the mechanism of shell quenching and deformation. By charge breeding ions, TITAN has enhanced the precision of the measurement technique. The precision achieved in the measurement of the superallowed $\beta$-emitter 74Rb in the 8+ charge state rivaled earlier measurements with singly charged ions in a fraction of the time. By breeding 78Rb to the same charge state, the ground state could be easily distinguished from the isomer. Further developments led to threshold charge breeding, which permitted capturing and measuring isobarically and elementally pure ion samples in the Penning trap. This was demonstrated via the Q-value determination of 71Ge. An overview of the TITAN facility and recent results are presented herein.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study of nuclei farther from the valley of ??-stability than ever before goes hand-in-hand with shorter-lived nuclei produced in smaller abundances than their less exotic counterparts. The measurement, to high precision, of nuclear masses therefore requires innovations in technique in order to keep up. TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) facility deploys three ion traps, with a fourth in the commissioning phase, to perform and support Penning trap mass spectrometry and in-trap decay spectroscopy on some of the shortest-lived nuclei ever studied. We report on recent advances and updates to the TITAN facility since the 2012 EMIS conference.TITAN's charge breeding capabilities have been improved and in-trap decay spectroscopy can be performed in TITAN's Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT). Higher charge states can improve the precision of mass measurements, reduce the beam-time requirements for a given measurement, improve beam purity, and open the door to access isotopes not available from the ISOL method via in-trap decay and recapture. This was recently demonstrated during TITAN's mass measurement of 30Al. The EBIT's decay spectroscopy setup was commissioned with a successful branching ratio and half-life measurement of 124Cs. Charge breeding in the EBIT increases the energy spread of the ion bunch sent to the Penning trap for mass measurement, so a new Cooler PEnning Trap (CPET), which aims to cool highly charged ions with an electron plasma, is undergoing offline commissioning. Already CPET has demonstrated the trapping and self-cooling of a room-temperature electron plasma that was stored for several minutes. A new detector has been installed inside the CPET magnetic field which will allow for in-magnet charged particle detection.},

To boost the precision TITAN has demonstrated that short-lived isotopes can be charge-bred to higher charge states within 10–100 s of ms using an electron beam ion trap. The charge breeding process increases the energy spread of the ions, which in turn affects the precision and the efficiency.

abstract = {Although the rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, is fundamentally important for explaining the origin of approximately half of the stable nuclei with A {\textgreater} 60, the astrophysical site of this process has not been identified yet. Here we study r-process nucleosynthesis in material that is dynamically ejected by tidal and pressure forces during the merging of binary neutron stars (NSs) and within milliseconds afterward. For the first time we make use of relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of such events, defining consistently the conditions that determine the nucleosynthesis, i.e., neutron enrichment, entropy, early density evolution and thus expansion timescale, and ejecta mass. We find that 10–3-10–2 M ☉ are ejected, which is enough for mergers to be the main source of heavy (A gsim 140) galactic r-nuclei for merger rates of some 10–5 yr–1. While asymmetric mergers eject 2-3 times more mass than symmetric ones, the exact amount depends weakly on whether the NSs have radii of {\~{}}15 km for a "stiff" nuclear equation of state (EOS) or {\~{}}12 km for a "soft" EOS. r-process nucleosynthesis during the decompression becomes largely insensitive to the detailed conditions because of efficient fission recycling, producing a composition that closely follows the solar r-abundance distribution for nuclei with mass numbers A {\textgreater} 140. Estimating the light curve powered by the radioactive decay heating of r-process nuclei with an approximative model, we expect high emission in the B-V-R bands for 1-2 days with potentially observable longer duration in the case of asymmetric mergers because of the larger ejecta mass.},

abstract = {We explore the impact of nuclear matter saturation on the properties and systematics of finite nuclei across the nuclear chart. Using the ab initio in-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG), we study ground-state energies and charge radii of closed-shell nuclei from {\$}{\^{}}4{\$}He to {\$}{\^{}}{\{}78{\}}{\$}Ni, based on a set of low-resolution two- and three-nucleon interactions that predict realistic saturation properties. We first investigate in detail the convergence properties of these Hamiltonians with respect to model-space truncations for both two- and three-body interactions. We find one particular interaction that reproduces well the ground-state energies of all closed-shell nuclei studied. As expected from their saturation points relative to this interaction, the other Hamiltonians underbind nuclei, but lead to a remarkably similar systematics of ground-state energies. Extending our calculations to complete isotopic chains in the {\$}sd{\$} and {\$}pf{\$} shells with the valence-space IM-SRG, the same interaction reproduces not only experimental ground states but two-neutron-separation energies and first excited {\$}2{\^{}}+{\$} states. We also calculate radii with the valence-space IM-SRG for the first time. Since this particular interaction saturates at too high density, charge radii are still too small compared with experiment. Except for this underprediction, the radii systematics is, however, well reproduced. Our results highlight the importance of nuclear matter as a theoretical benchmark for the development of next-generation chiral interactions.},

Since charged particle reactions in a stellar environment are very temperature sensitive, we use a realistic time-dependent general relativistic and self-consistent model of type I x-ray bursts to provide accurate values of the burst temperatures and densities. This allows a detailed and accurate time-dependent identification of the reaction flow from the surface layers through the convective region and the ignition region to the neutron star ocean. Using this, we determine the relative importance of specific nuclear reactions in the X-ray burst.},

A new stabilization mechanism has been investigated with the help of systematic experiments in the ELTRAP (ELectron TRAP) device where a high-frequency, low-amplitude drive has been applied on an azimuthally sectored electrode. An effective confining force is created, which reduces the offset of the column from the center. This interpretation and its theoretical analysis show a qualitative agreement with the experimental findings, where a net confinement effect is present for a wide range of drive amplitudes and frequencies.},

More than 300 fission products have been measured with JYFLTRAP, ISOLTRAP, CPT, LEBIT and TITAN Penning traps with a typical precision of $\delta$m/m ≈ 10−7 − 10−8. In general, the results agree well with each other. The new data provide a valuable source of information and a challenge for the future development of theoretical mass models as well as for obtaining a deeper insight into microscopic properties of atomic nuclei as measured, for example, via key mass differentials. Shape transitions around N = 60, subshell closure at N = 40 and shell closures at N = 50 and N = 82 have been investigated in the trend of the precisely measured two-neutron separation energies. The evolution of two-neutron and two-proton shell gaps has been studied and compared to theoretical models for Z = 50, N = 50 and N = 82. Proton–neutron pairing effect in separation energies and odd–even staggering of masses are shortly discussed. In addition to nuclear structure, many experiments have been motivated by nuclear astrophysics.},

These quantities are particularly relevant to determine the composition of the matter resulting from the decompression of initially cold neutron star matter. New detailed r-process calculations are performed and the final composition of ejected inner and outer neutron star crust material is estimated. We discuss the impact of the many uncertainties in the astrophysics and nuclear physics on the final composition of the ejected matter.

abstract = {The $\beta$-decay$\beta$-decay Paul trap is a linear radiofrequency-quadrupole ion trap that has been developed for precision $\beta$-decay$\beta$-decay studies. The design of the trap electrodes allows a variety of radiation detectors to surround the cloud of trapped ions. The momentum of the low-energy recoiling daughter nuclei following $\beta$$\beta$ decay is negligibly perturbed by scattering and is available for study. This advantageous property of traps allows the kinematics of particles that are difficult or even impossible to directly detect to be precisely reconstructed using conservation of energy and momentum. An ion-trap system offers several advantages over atom traps, such as higher trapping efficiencies and element-independent capabilities. The first precision experiment using this system is a measurement of $\beta$-decay$\beta$-decay angular correlations in the decay of 8Li performed by inferring the momentum of the neutrino from the kinematic shifts imparted to the breakup $\alpha$$\alpha$ particles.

In practice, the quadrupole rods are mounted within a grounded housing not much larger than the electrode structure itself. This study determines the operating parameters and optimum electrode size for a quadrupole with electrodes of circular cross section located within a zero-potential cylindrical surface. It is found that the rod size is only weakly dependent on the location of the external, zero-potential surface and the optimum rod size is r=1.1468r0 for a cylinder radius of 3.54r0. Although the optimum rod size is only 1.15{\%} smaller than the commonly used value of r=1.16r0, it is found that 43{\%} higher sensitivity at a resolution of 400 ($\Delta$M measured at half-height) results from using the optimum radius electrodes.},

abstract = {Tagging with charged particles and $\gamma$-rays at the focal plane of recoil separators has proven, over the last two decades, to be a very powerful tool for the identification of excited states in exotic nuclei produced with very low cross-sections. One of the key areas so far unexplored in terms of the tagging methodology has been performing correlations with $\beta$-particles at the focal plane of a recoil separator. A new technique entitled Recoil-Beta Tagging (RBT) has been developed, this technique exploits the unusual properties of Fermi super-allowed $\beta$ emitters, which have both a short half-life (∼ 100 ms) and high $\beta$+-endpoint energy. Correlating with such $\beta$-particles using a double-sided silicon strip detector and planar germanium detector as an effective $\Delta$ E - E telescope for high-energy positrons has allowed a proof-of-principle of this technique to be carried out, by cleanly identifying excited states in the proton-drip-line nucleus, 74Rb. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This is because many more masses of participating nuclei are involved in the ImKG mass relations for predicting the masses of unknown proton-rich nuclei. The masses for 144 unknown proton-rich nuclei with 6≤A≤74 are predicted by using the ImKG mass relations.

This apparatus consists of an up-to 6 Tesla, open-access spectroscopy ion-trap, surrounded radially by up to 7 planar Si(Li) detectors which are separated from the trap by thin Be windows. This configuration provides a significant increase in sensitivity for the detection of low-energy photons by providing backing-free ion storage and eliminating charged-particle-induced backgrounds. An intense electron beam is also employed to increase the charge-states of the trapped ions, thus providing storage times on the order of minutes, allowing for decay-spectroscopy measurements. The technique of multiple ion-bunch stacking was also recently demonstrated, which further extends the measurement possibilities of this apparatus. The current status of the facility and initial results from a 116In measurement are presented.},

To realize this potential, however, the heart must be reliably placed in the appropriate small FOV prior to imaging, thus requiring a separate scout operation to locate the heart and estimate its size. Furthermore, to achieve high performance across the general population, a system should provide several imaging configurations optimized for different size and location of the heart and the size of the patient. Because of the critical role the collimator plays in SPECT, it would be ideal if a dedicated collimator could be used for each of the different patient groups, as well as for the scout imaging. The ability to exchange collimators without moving the patient can also enable serial studies with different imaging options while preserving anatomic registration.},

Despite the simplicity of this concept, and the enormous utility of electron spectroscopy in nuclear and particle physics, single-electron cyclotron radiation has never been observed directly. Here we demonstrate single-electron detection in a novel radiofrequency spec- trometer. We observe the cyclotron radiation emitted by individual magnetically-trapped electrons that are produced with mildly-relativistic energies by a gaseous radioactive source. The relativistic shift in the cyclotron frequency permits a precise electron energy measurement. Precise beta elec- tron spectroscopy from gaseous radiation sources is a key technique in modern efforts to measure the neutrino mass via the tritium decay endpoint, and this work demonstrates a fundamentally new approach to precision beta spectroscopy for future neutrino mass experiments.},

Within the density-dependent cluster model, the density distributions of studied daughter nuclei are determined by exactly reproducing the corresponding experimental $\alpha$ decay half-lives, which leads the final results of nuclear charge radii. In addition, our recently proposed formula deducing the charge radii is extended to this study for comparison. Whether it concerns the ground or isomeric state of target nuclei, the extracted nuclear charge radii are found to be in good agreement with the measured values. Sequential predictions on the rms charge radii are subsequently made for these neutron-deficient nuclei and especially for the rarely detected Bi isotopic chain, which are expected to be useful for future measurements. Moreover, the variety of $\alpha$-preformation factors is analyzed in the scheme of valence nucleon number to pursue the further improvement of the model. This may be considered as an effective effort to obtain the charge radii of ground and even low-lying excited states for exotic nuclei near the proton-dripline.},

These measurements were possible through the use of a unique ion-guide laser ion source, a development that suppressed isobaric contamination by 6 orders of magnitude. Compared to the latest atomic mass evaluation, we find that the mass of Mg21 is in good agreement but that the mass of Mg20 deviates by 3$\sigma$. These measurements reduce the uncertainties in the masses of Mg20,21 by 15 and 22 times, respectively, resulting in a significant departure from the expected behavior of the isobaric multiplet mass equation in both the A=20 and A=21 multiplets.

In recent calculations the nuclear level density—as an important ingredient to the statistical model (Hauser-Feshbach)—has shown the highest uncertainties. We present a global parametrization of nuclear level densities within the back-shifted Fermi-gas formalism. Employment of an energy-dependent level density parameter a, based on microscopic corrections from a recent finite range droplet model mass formula, and a backshift $\delta$, based on pairing and shell corrections, leads to a highly improved fit of level densities at the neutron-separation energy in the mass range 20{\textless}{\~{}}A{\textless}{\~{}}245. The importance of using proper microscopic corrections from mass formulas is emphasized. The resulting level description is well suited for astrophysical applications. The level density can also provide clues to the applicability of the statistical model which is only correct for a high density of excited states. Using the above description, one can derive a “map” for the applicability of the model to reactions of stable and unstable nuclei with neutral and charged particles.},

Precision mass measurements of short-lived isotopes is one such endeavour that can probe the unitarity of the CKM matrix, test the CVC hypothesis, understand the nucle- osynthesis path, nuclear structure and help improve nuclear mass models [1, 2]. TITAN at TRIUMF is a facility where precision mass measurement of short-lived isotopes is car- ried out. The unique feature of TITAN is the combination of three online ion traps that enables mass measurement of short-lived isotopes with very high precision. Presently an EBIT increases the charge state to improve the precision [3]. However, the charge breeding process causes a large energy spread. Accuracy of measured mass is linearly de- pendent on charge state, while the increased emittance of the beam has a negative impact on trapping efficiency and hence on precision. To overcome this drawback, a cooler Penning trap has been constructed. The trap is designed to use charged particles to reduce the beam emittance by sympathetic cooling, and it is currently undergoing off-line tests. Working principles and updates on the status of the TITAN cooler trap are presented in this paper.},

We consider such early times that the wind still contains a proton excess because the rates for $\nu$e and positron captures on neutrons are faster than those for the inverse captures on protons. Following a suggestion by Fr{\"{o}}hlich and coworkers, we also include the possibility that—in addition to the protons, $\alpha$-particles, and heavy seed—a small flux of neutrons is maintained by the reaction p(img1.gife, e+)n. This flux of neutrons is critical in bridging the long waiting points along the path of the rp-process by (n, p) reactions. Using the unmodified ejecta histories from a recent two-dimensional supernova model by Janka and coworkers, we find synthesis of p-rich nuclei up to 102Pd, although our calculations do not show efficient production of 92Mo. If the entropy of these ejecta is increased by a factor of 2, the synthesis extends to 120Te. Still larger increases in entropy, which might reflect the role of magnetic fields or vibrational energy input neglected in the hydrodynamical model, result in the production of nuclei up to A ≈ 170. Elements synthesized in these more extreme outflows include numerous s- and p-process nuclei, and even some r-process nuclei can be synthesized in these proton-rich conditions.},

We report the first mass measurements of Ar48 and Ar49 and find atomic mass excesses of −22.28(31) MeV and −17.8(1.1) MeV, respectively. These masses provide strong evidence for the closed shell nature of neutron number N=28 in argon, which is therefore the lowest even-Z element exhibiting the N=28 closed shell. The resulting trend in binding-energy differences, which probes the strength of the N=28 shell, compares favorably with shell-model calculations in the sd-pf shell using SDPF-U and SDPF-MU Hamiltonians.},

The principal result is a new prescription for the cyclotron frequency in terms of the observable eigenfrequencies of the imperfect trap. The new prescription is completely insensitive to a misalignment of the magnetic field direction with the axis of the Penning electrodes, and it is also insensitive to the most significant imperfections in the electrostatic potential. These systematic effects can therefore be completely circumvented in measurements of the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and positron, and also in experiments on protons and heavier ions where the effects are much larger.},

abstract = {To date, V ud of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix is most pre- cisely determined from superallowed 0 + ! 0 + nuclear -decays. In addition to half-life, Branching Ratio, and transition energy (called Q EC -value) of a superal- lowed decay, theoretical corrections have to be considered to extract V ud . Among those, the isospin symmetry breaking corrections, C , show discrepancies between different theoretical models, which are critical to be resolved. 74 Rb has the largest C of all 13 superallowed -emitters used to obtain V ud and would carry particular weight to discriminate between models were it not limited by the uncertainty in the Q EC -value. However, 74 Rb's half-life of 65 ms has previously posed a real challenge to the experimental precision in its Q EC -value, which is best determined by direct mass measurements in Penning traps. In this work, Penning trap mass measurements of short-lived nuclides have been performed for the first time with highly-charged ions, using the TITAN facility. Compared to singly-charged ions, this provides an improvement in experimental precision that scales with the charge state q . Neutron-deficient Rb-isotopes have been prepared in an electron beam ion trap to q = 8},

abstract = {The r-process of nucleosynthesis is the process which is responsible for the synthesis of approximately half of the nuclear species in nature that are more massive than iron. This process of heavy-element synthesis involves the progressive buildup of heavier isotopes via neut ron captures proceeding on neutron-rich isotopes, interspersed by beta decays. Its abudance features clearly reflect nuclear propeties — the maxima are related to the magic neutron numbers N = 50, 82 and 126. It probes our knowledge of the properties of nuclei far from the region of beta stability, even through the position of the neutron drip line. The r-process also forms the important long-lived nuclear chronometers 232Th, 238U and 235U that are utilized for dating the Galaxy. While the astrophysical site foprocess nucleosynthesis is not yet identified, its association with massive stars undergoing type II supernova events is strongly suggested. This can be deduced from the observation that r-process nuclei are already present in the oldest and most metal-deficient stars, which are the tracers of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The massive stars that become type II supernovae evolve fastest and contribute their ejecta to the interstellar medium at the earliest beginnings of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. When utilizing the knowledge of the r-process production ratios of the long-lived chronometer nuclei, their observed ratios in primitive meteorites and our (limited) knowledge of star formation throughout galactic evolution, one can put limits on the duration of galactic nucleosynthesis, the age of the Galaxy and the universe. The latter has a large uncertainty but is comparable with ages estimated from globular clusters and cosmology. This paper will provide a review of the basic physics underlying the r-process, the operation of the mechanisms for r-process nucleosynthesis, the possible astrophysical sites, their time evolution in galactic evolution models, and the inferred ages of the Galaxy.},

abstract = {Half a century has passed since the foundation of nuclear astrophysics. Since then, this discipline has reached its maturity. Today, nuclear astrophysics constitutes a multidisciplinary crucible of knowledge that combines the achievements in theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, cosmochemistry and nuclear physics. New tools and developments have revolutionized our understanding of the origin of the elements: supercomputers have provided astrophysicists with the required computational capabilities to study the evolution of stars in a multidimensional framework; the emergence of high-energy astrophysics with space-borne observatories has opened new windows to observe the Universe, from a novel panchromatic perspective; cosmochemists have isolated tiny pieces of stardust embedded in primitive meteorites, giving clues on the processes operating in stars as well as on the way matter condenses to form solids; and nuclear physicists have measured reactions near stellar energies, through the combined efforts using stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. This review provides comprehensive insight into the nuclear history of the Universe and related topics: starting from the Big Bang, when the ashes from the primordial explosion were transformed to hydrogen, helium, and few trace elements, to the rich variety of nucleosynthesis mechanisms and sites in the Universe. Particular attention is paid to the hydrostatic processes governing the evolution of low-mass stars, red giants and asymptotic giant-branch stars, as well as to the explosive nucleosynthesis occurring in core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, classical novae, X-ray bursts, superbursts, and stellar mergers.},

abstract = {The rapid neutron capture process (r-process) is thought to be responsible for the creation of more than half of all elements beyond iron. The scientific challenges to understanding the origin of the heavy elements beyond iron lie in both the uncertainties associated with astrophysical conditions that are needed to allow an r-process to occur and a vast lack of knowledge about the properties of nuclei far from stability. There is great global competition to access and measure the most exotic nuclei that existing facilities can reach, while simultaneously building new, more powerful accelerators to make even more exotic nuclei. This work is an attempt to determine the most crucial nuclear masses to measure using an r-process simulation code and several mass models (FRDM, Duflo-Zuker, and HFB-21). The most important nuclear masses to measure are determined by the changes in the resulting r-process abundances. Nuclei around the closed shells near N = 50 , 82, and 126 have the largest impact on r-process abundances irrespective of the mass models used.},

abstract = {A 410 MeV/u 238U projectile beam was used to create cadmium isotopes via abrasion-fission in a beryllium target placed at the entrance of the in-flight separator FRS at GSI. The fission fragments were separated by the FRS and injected into the isochronous storage ring ESR for mass measurements. Isochronous Mass Spectrometry (IMS) was performed under two different experimental conditions, with and without B$\rho$-tagging at the high-resolution central focal plane of the FRS. In the experiment with B$\rho$-tagging the magnetic rigidity of the injected fragments was determined with an accuracy of 2⋅10-4. A new method of data analysis, which uses a correlation matrix for the combined data set from both experiments, has provided experimental mass values of 25 rare isotopes for the first time. The high sensitivity and selectivity of the method have given access to nuclides detected with a rate of a few atoms per week. In this letter we present for the 129,130,131Cd isotopes mass values directly measured for the first time. The experimental mass values of cadmium as well as for tellurium and tin isotopes show a pronounced shell effect towards and at N=82. Shell quenching cannot be deduced from a single new mass value, nor by a better agreement with a theoretical model which explicitly takes into account a quenching feature. This is in agreement with the conclusion from $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy and confirms modern shell-model calculations.},

abstract = {The “self-shielding” m=1diocotron mode in Malmberg–Penning traps has been known for over a decade to be unstable for finite length non-neutral plasmas with hollow density profiles. Early theoretical efforts were unsuccessful in accounting for the exponential growth and/or the magnitude of the growth rate. Recent theoretical work has sought to resolve the discrepancy either as a consequence of the shape of the plasma ends or as a kinetic effect resulting from a modified distribution function as a consequence of the protocol used to form the hollow profiles in experiments. Both of these finite length mechanisms have been investigated in selected test cases using a three-dimensional particle-in-cell code that allows realistic treatment of shape and kinetic effects. A persistent discrepancy of a factor of 2–3 remains between simulation and experimental values of the growth rate. Simulations reported here are more in agreement with theoretical predictions and fail to explain the discrepancy.},

abstract = {As part of an ongoing program to study fundamental symmetries in nuclear physics, a thorough investigation into shell-model isospin-symmetry-breaking (ISB) calculation theory has been conducted using direct reactions to observe detailed nuclear-structure information. The work presented in this Thesis focuses on the 62Ga superallowed $\beta$-decay system, and consists of two primary experiments; 1) A 64Zn(? d,t)63Zn single- neutron transfer reaction, aimed at observing spectroscopic strengths to help guide calculationmodel-space truncations for the $\beta$-decay wave function radial-overlap com- ponent of ISB, and 2) A two-neutron 64Zn(p,t)62Zn transfer to search for excited 0+ states in the daughter nucleus of 62Ga. The experiments were performed at theMaier- Leibnitz-Laboratory, on the joint campuses of the Ludwig-Maximilians Universit¨ at and the Technische Universit¨ at M¨ unchen, in Garching, Germany. In total, 162 states in 63Zn were populated from the 64Zn(? d,t) reaction, up to an excitation energy of 4.8 MeV, including the observation of 125 new levels, and unique J$\pi$ assignments for 92 states. As a result, this work provides the most complete picture for low-spin states in 63Zn to date. A comparison of the extracted C2S values to the predicted shell-model spectroscopic factors shows an overall over-prediction of strength for the 2p3/2 orbital, and a large disagreement for the 1f7/2 orbital above ∼ 3.5 MeV. No significant 1g9/2 strength was observed, leading to the conclusion that the importance of the 1g9/2 orbital for ISB is small. Additionally, 67 states were observed in 62Zn using the two-neutron pickup mech- anism, including the observation of five 0+ states. More than 99{\%} of the total 0+ (p,t) cross-section is observed in the ground-state reaction channel, implying a nearly maximal overlap of the wave functions with the two-nucleon transfer operator. The dominance of the ground-state-to-ground-state (p,t) cross section is strikingly similar to the dominance of the superallowed Fermi $\beta$-decay between isobaric-analogue 0+ states. This suggests that the population of excited 0+ states in the (p,t) reaction may reflect the population in the Fermi decay process, and can be used to guide future experimental and theoretical work. Further discussion of these results as they relate to the ISB correction calculations, and the implications for future theoretical work are presented in this Thesis.},

abstract = {Rapid neutron-capture (i.e., r-process) nucleosynthesis calculations, employing internally consistent and physically realistic nuclear physics input (quasi-particle random-phase approximation [QRPA] $\beta$-decay properties and the recent extended Thomas-Fermi with Strutinsky integral and quenching (ETFSI-Q) nuclear mass model), have been performed. These theoretical computations assume the classical waiting-point approximation of (n,$\gamma$) rlarr2 ($\gamma$,n) equilibrium. The calculations reproduce the solar isotopic r-abundances in detail, including the heaviest stable Pb and Bi isotopes. These calculations are then compared with ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope observations of neutron-capture elements in the metal-poor halo stars CS 22892-052, HD 115444, HD 122563, and HD 126238. The elemental abundances in all four metal-poor stars are consistent with the solar r-process elemental distribution for the elements Z ≥ 56. These results strongly suggest, at least for those elements, that the relative elemental r-process abundances have not changed over the history of the Galaxy. This indicates also that it is unlikely that the solar r-process abundances resulted from a random superposition of varying abundance patterns from different r-process nucleosynthesis sites. This further suggests that there is one r-process site in the Galaxy, at least for elements Z ≥ 56. Employing the observed stellar abundances of stable elements, in conjunction with the solar r-process abundances to constrain the calculations, we present predictions for the zero decay-age abundances of the radioactive elements Th and U. We compare these predictions (obtained with the mass model ETFSI-Q, which reproduces solar r-abundances best) with newly derived observational values in three very metal-poor halo stars: HD 115444, CS 22892-052, and HD 122563. Within the observational errors the ratio of [Th/Eu] is the same in both CS 22892-052 and HD 115444. Comparing with the theoretical ratio suggests an average age of these two very metal-poor stars to be 15.6 ± 4.6 Gyr, consistent with earlier radioactive age estimates and recent globular and cosmological age estimates. Our upper limit on the uranium abundance in HD 115444 also implies a similar age. Such radioactive age determinations of very low metallicity stars avoid uncertainties in Galactic chemical evolution models. They still include uncertainties due to the involved nuclear physics far from $\beta$-stability. However, we give an extensive overview of the possible variations expected and come to the conclusion that this aspect alone should not exceed limits of 3 Gyr. Therefore this method shows promise as an independent dating technique for the Galaxy.},

abstract = {Stored waveform excitation produced by inverse Fourier transformation of a specified magnitude/phase excitation spectrum offers the most general and versatile means for broadband mass-selective excitation and ejection in Penning (FT-ICR) and Paul (quadrupole) ion trap mass spectrometry. Since the last comprehensive review of SWIFT excitation in 1987, the technique has been adopted, modified, and extended widely in both the ICR and quadrupole ion trap communities. Here, we review the principles, variations, algorithms, hardware implementation, and some applications of SWIFT for both ICR and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry. We show that the most desirable SWIFT waveform is that optimized to reduce both the time-domain SWIFT maximum amplitude and the amplitude near the start and end of the SWIFT waveform. We examine the “true” magnitude excitation spectrum, obtained by zero-filling and forward Fourier transforming the SWIFT time-domain waveform, in order to evaluate the trade-off between spectral magnitude uniformity and frequency (mass) selectivity. Apodization of the SWIFT waveform is optimally conducted by smoothing the excitation magnitude spectrum prior to generation of the SWIFT waveform by inverse FT. When (as for broadband ejection in a quadrupole ion trap) it is important that ions be excited near-simultaneously over a wide mass range, the phase spectrum (before inverse FT to generate the SWIFT waveform) may be overmodulated or randomly modulated (“filtered noise field”), with the recognition that very substantial non-uniformity in the “true” excitation magnitude spectrum will result.},

abstract = {The nucleosynthetic path of the astrophysical r-process and the resulting elemental abundances depend on neutron-separation energies which can be determined from the masses of the nuclei along the r-process reaction path. Due to the current lack of experimental data, mass models are often used. The mass values provided by the mass models are often too imprecise or disagree with each other. Therefore, direct high-precision mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclei are necessary to provide input parameters to the calculations and help refine the mass models. The Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) facility of Argonne National Laboratory will provide experiments with beams of short-lived neutron-rich nuclei. The Canadian Penning Trap (CPT) mass spectrometer has been relocated to the CARIBU low-energy beam line to extend measurements of the neutron-rich nuclei into the mostly unexplored region along the r-process path. This will allow precise mass measurements ({\~{}} 10 keV/c2) of more than a hundred very neutron-rich isotopes that have not previously been measured.},

abstract = {We want to commission the DESCANT neutron detectors on GRIFFIN with beta-delayed neutron-decay experiments of neutron-rich 145-149Cs (N=90-94). Assuming a neutron detection efficiency of 27{\%} for DESCANT, an efficiency for SCEPTAR as b-trigger of 80{\%} and duty cycles between 6s and 0.5 s, we aim for min. 500 000 bn-events for each isotope for reasonable neutron spectroscopy. In parallel we will tag with GRIFFIN on individual gamma-lines in the respective Ba decay daughters and thus perform first experiments with GRIFFIN coupled to DESCANT. The neutron branching ratios (P n-values) of 145,146Cs are well established by several independent measurements. However, for 147,148Cs only a few (partially discrepant) measurements exist, and 149Cs is complete terra incognita until now since no information about ground-state spin and parity, half-life, the P n-value, or about excited states in 149Ba exist. Neutron spectra are available only for 145-147Cs which are based on measurements carried out in the 1970ies with 3Hefilled neutron counters. These measurements reach up to E n= 1.1-1.8 MeV for 145-147Cs. From the viewpoint of nuclear structure, nuclei in the region of N=88 and 90 display a fascinating variety of nuclear structure phenomena. There is a rapid change in the quadruple deformation which, in the heavier Z systems like the Nd, Sm, and Gd, and Dy isotopes, have been characterized as a phase transition. In fact, the N=90 isotopes have been suggested to be at the critical point of the phase transition. This suggestion, however, has been challenged by very detailed spectroscopy for 152Sm. Combining the branching ratios obtained with betadecay with lifetimes determined by a variety of techniques including with the DSAM (Doppler-Shift Attenuation Method) technique following inelastic neutron scattering, a large number of B(E2) values allowed a very detailed mapping of the quadrupole collectivity and sensitive tests of various models. Further, highly sensitive spectroscopy following Coulomb excitation failed to locate the strongly collective K p=0 + bands predicted in the critical point X(5) model to be built on the 0 + 2 state. An alternative suggestion for the structure of the N=90 isotones has been put forward that involves a “second vacuum”; the 0 + 2 state being built on a different set of configurations (so-called oblate orbitals) that have different pairing matrix elements from those involved in the ground state (prolate orbitals) with weak pairing matrix elements between them. This suggestion appears to be consistent with the observation of a repeating pattern of excitations observed in 152Sm and also the spectroscopy of the odd-A Gd isotopes},

abstract = {An r-process scenario with fission but without fission cycling is considered to account for the observed abundance patterns of neutron-capture elements in ultra-metal-poor stars. It is proposed that neutrino reactions play a crucial role in inducing the fission of the progenitor nuclei after the r-process freezes out in Type II supernovae. To facilitate neutrino-induced fission, the proposed r-process scenario is restricted to occur in a low-density environment, such as the neutrino-driven wind from the neutron star. Further studies to develop this scenario are emphasized.},

The $\beta$-detector telescope of this system consists of a large E-scintillation counter, which works in coincidence with a thin $\Delta$E-detector. In addition, the E-scintillator is surrounded by a scintillator ring working in anticoincidence mode with the E-detector. All photomultipliers are cooled by Peltier elements in order to reduce and to stabilize their temperature. This telescope has been tested with monoenergetic electrons in the energy range between 500 keV and 10500 keV at the conversion electron spectrometer BILL of the ILL. In order to demonstrate the performance of the coincidence system, the endpoint energies of $\beta$-spectra emitted in the decay of 92Kr, 139I and 139Xe have been measured at the mass separator LOHENGRIN. The total experimental errors of the Q$\beta$-values derived from these measurements are smaller than 30 keV.},

We propose a new mechanism of destabilization of this mode, involving parallel compression due to end curvature. The results are in good agreement with the experiments. The resulting modified drift-Poisson equations are analogous to the geophysical shallow water equations, and conservation of line integrated density corresponds to that of potential vorticity.

For a simple density distribution, the normal modes of the electron beam correspond to a continuum of eigenvalues, plus two discrete eigenvalues. Work due to Case and Dikii appears to show that the continuous spectrum is not important in stability studies of this type. The condition for stability considering the discrete modes only is derived; under suitable geometrical and electrical conditions, it is shown that these modes can be stable. The analogy between the electromagnetic problem considered here and the problem of the stability of an ideal rotating fluid is discussed. It is shown that stability conditions derived for the latter problem depend on the possibility of axial perturbations; what this implies for the electron beam problem is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Highly charged ions (HCI) have recently been introduced to the mass spectrometry of short-lived nuclides with Penning traps. In comparison to singly charged ions, HCI enable a gain in achievable experimental precision by a factor identical to the charge state q. When combined with advanced excitation methods such as a Ramsey scheme, this technique has the potential to improve the precision by 1-2 orders of magnitude over the conventionally achieved precision. At the TITAN facility at TRIUMF - to date unique in this approach for measurements of rare isotopes - HCI are formed in an electron beam ion trap (EBIT). This fulfils the requirement of fast and efficient charge breeding that is imperative for online produced nuclides. So far, HCI of rare isotopes with half-lives as short as 65 ms or charge states up to q = 22+ have been successfully used for mass measurements. In addition, HCI offer novel opportunities in the suppression of contaminating isobars, typically a major problem when exploring the nuclear mass surface ever closer to the drip-lines. Particularly, charge breeding to electronic shell closures results in a distinction of different isobars in their corresponding charge state and consequently allows for separation independently of isobaric mass differences. Finally, HCI serve as a tool for increased resolution, valuable in the study of low-lying isomers. This was demonstrated at TITAN with the mass doublet 78m78Rb which requires a resolving power of R ??? 6.5 ?? 105. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a review of the possible sources for r-process nuclei. It is known that there is as yet no self-consistent mechanism to provide abundant neutrons for a robust r-process in the neutrino-driven winds from nascent neutron stars. We consider that the heavy r-nuclei with mass numbers A{\textgreater}130 (Ba and above) cannot be produced in the neutrino-driven winds. Nonetheless, the r-process and the neutrino-driven winds may be directly or indirectly related by some unknown additional mechanism, which, for example, could provide ejecta with very short dynamic timescales of {\textless}0.004 s. This undetermined mechanism must supply a neutron source within the same general stellar sites that undergo core collapse to produce the neutron star. Observational data on low-metallicity stars in the Galactic halo show that sites producing the heavy r-nuclei do not produce Fe or any other elements between N and Ge. Insofar as a forming neutron star is key to producing the heavy r-nuclei, then the only possible sources are supernovae resulting from collapse of O-Ne-Mg cores or accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs, neither of which produce the elements of the Fe group or those of intermediate mass (above C and N). Using a template star with high enrichments of heavy r-nuclei and another with low enrichments we develop a two-component model based on the abundances of Eu (from sources for heavy r-nuclei) and Fe (from Fe core-collapse supernovae). This model gives very good quantitative predictions for the abundances of all the other elements in those metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]{\textless}-1.5 for which the Eu and Fe abundances are known.

abstract = {Nuclear astrophysics is that branch of astrophysics which helps understanding of the Universe, or at least some of its many faces, through the knowledge of the microcosm of the atomic nucleus. It attempts to find as many nuclear physics imprints as possible in the macrocosm, and to decipher what those messages are telling us about the varied constituent objects in the Universe at present and in the past. In the last decades much advance has been made in nuclear astrophysics thanks to the sometimes spectacular progress made in the modelling of the structure and evolution of the stars, in the quality and diversity of the astronomical observations, as well as in the experimental and theoretical understanding of the atomic nucleus and of its spontaneous or induced transformations. Developments in other subfields of physics and chemistry have also contributed to that advance. Notwithstanding the accomplishment, many long-standing problems remain to be solved, and the theoretical understanding of a large variety of observational facts needs to be put on safer grounds. In addition, new questions are continuously emerging, and new facts endangering old ideas. This review shows that astrophysics has been, and still is, highly demanding to nuclear physics in both its experimental and theoretical components. On top of the fact that large varieties of nuclei have to be dealt with, these nuclei are immersed in highly unusual environments which may have a significant impact on their static properties, the diversity of their transmutation modes, and on the probabilities of these modes. In order to have a chance of solving some of the problems nuclear astrophysics is facing, the astrophysicists and nuclear physicists are obviously bound to put their competence in common, and have sometimes to benefit from the help of other fields of physics, like particle physics, plasma physics or solid-state physics. Given the highly varied and complex aspects, we pick here some specific nuclear physics topics which largely pervade nuclear astrophysics.},

It differs from the various geometrical arrangements that sometimes occur in a molecule in that in a molecule the various arrangements are of the widely separated atomic nuclei. In nuclei the various arrangements of nucleons involve (sets of) energy eigenstates with different electric quadrupole properties such as moments and transition rates, and different distributions of proton pairs and neutron pairs with respect to their Fermi energies. Sometimes two such structures will invert as a function of the nucleon number, resulting in a sudden and dramatic change in ground-state properties in neighboring isotopes and isotones. In the first part of this review the theoretical status of coexistence in nuclei is summarized. Two approaches, namely, microscopic shell-model descriptions and mean-field descriptions, are emphasized. The second part of this review presents systematic data, for both even- and odd-mass nuclei, selected to illustrate the various ways in which coexistence is observed in nuclei. The last part of this review looks to future developments and the issue of the universality of coexistence in nuclei. Surprises continue to be discovered. With the major advances in reaching to extremes of proton-neutron number, and the anticipated new rare isotope beam facilities, guidelines for search and discovery are discussed.},

abstract = {For mirror nuclei with masses A=42–95, the effects of isospin-nonconserving nuclear forces are studied with the nuclear shell model using the Coulomb displacement energy and triplet displacement energy as probes. It is shown that the characteristic behavior of the displacement energies can be well reproduced if the isovector and isotensor nuclear interactions with J=0 and T=1 are introduced into the f7/2 shell. These forces, with their strengths being found consistent with the nucleon-nucleon scattering data, tend to modify nuclear binding energies near the N=Z line. At present, no evidence is found that these forces are needed for the upper fp shell. Theoretical one- and two-proton separation energies are predicted accordingly, and locations of the proton drip line are thereby suggested.},

@article{Moller2016,
abstract = {We tabulate the atomic mass excesses and binding energies, ground-state shell-plus-pairing corrections, ground-state microscopic corrections, and nuclear ground-state deformations of 9318 nuclei ranging from 16O to A=339. The calculations are based on the finite-range droplet macroscopic and the folded-Yukawa single-particle microscopic nuclear-structure models, which are completely specified. Relative to our FRDM(1992) mass table in M??ller et al. (1995), the results are obtained in the same model, but with considerably improved treatment of deformation and fewer of the approximations that were necessary earlier, due to limitations in computer power. The more accurate execution of the model and the more extensive and more accurate experimental mass data base now available allow us to determine one additional macroscopic-model parameter, the density-symmetry coefficient L, which was not varied in the previous calculation, but set to zero. Because we now realize that the FRDM is inaccurate for some highly deformed shapes occurring in fission, because some effects are derived in terms of perturbations around a sphere, we only adjust its macroscopic parameters to ground-state masses.The values of ten constants are determined directly from an optimization to fit ground-state masses of 2149 nuclei ranging from 16O to 106265Sg and 108264Hs. The error of the mass model is 0.5595 MeV for the entire region of nuclei included in the adjustment, but is only 0.3549 MeV for the region N???65.We also provide masses in the FRLDM, which in the more accurate treatments now has an error of 0.6618 MeV, with 0.5181 MeV for nuclei with N???65, both somewhat larger than in the FRDM. But in contrast to the FRDM, it is suitable for studies of fission and has been extensively so applied elsewhere, with FRLDM(2002) constants. The FRLDM(2012) fits 31 fission-barrier heights from 70Se to 252Cf with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.052 MeV.},

@article{Thielemann2010,
abstract = {The processes discussed in this review are three of the four nucleosynthesis processes involved in producing heavy nuclei beyond Fe (not counting the rp-process in X- ray bursts). Opposite to the fourth process (the s-process), which operates in stellar evolution during He- and C-burning, they are all related to explosive burning phases, (presumably) linked to core collapse supernova events of massive stars. The (classical) p-process is identified with explosive Ne/O-burning in outer zones of the progenitor star. It is intitiated by the passage of the supernova shock wave and acts via photodisintegration reactions like a spallation process which produces neighboring (proton-rich) isotopes from pre-existing heavy nuclei. The reproduction of some of the so-called lighter p-isotopes with A {\textless} 100 faces problems in this environment. The only recently discovered $\nu$p-process is related to the innermost ejecta, the neutrino wind expelled from the hot proto-neutron star after core collapse in the supernova explosion. This neutrino wind is proton-rich in its early phase and reactions with neutrinos permit to overcome decay/reaction bottlenecks for the flow beyond the Fe-group, thus permitting the production of those p-isotopes, which face problems in the classical p-process scenario. The understanding of the r-process, being identified for a long time with rapid neutron captures - and passing through nuclei far from stability - is still experiencing major problems. These are on the one hand related to nuclear uncertainties far from stability (masses and half-lives), affecting the process speed and abundance peaks, on the other hand the site is still not definitely located, yet. Later neutron- rich, high entropy phases of the neutrino wind could permit its operation, other options include the ejection of very neutron-rich neutron star matter. Two different environments are required for a weak and a main/strong r-process, witnessed by observations of low metallicity stars.},

The analysis is restricted to the experimentally important special case that the axial motion (z-direction) is not coupled to that in the xy-plane, so that both motions can be treated separately. The method views the cyclotron frequency $\omega$c as a complex variable that can be continued analytically from real values (undamped case) into the complex plane. The power of the approach becomes obvious in connection with advanced problems such as the calculation of line profiles for quadrupole excitation.},

abstract = {Abundances of 244Pu, 235U, 238U, and 232Th in the early solar system are about those expected for uniform production over most of galactic history. The inferred abundance of 182Hf is also compatible with this model. We here associate production of 182Hf with the same r-process SN sources that produce actinides (SNACS). This requires that r-process nucleosynthesis in SNACS took place rather uniformly over the age of the galaxy until {\~{}}107 yr prior to solar system formation. The low abundance of 107Pd and 129I in the early solar system indicates that SNACS cannot produce these nuclei at the high yields expected from standard r-process models. We propose that there are distinctive SN sources for different r-process nuclei with a sharp distinction in different SN contributions below and above A {\~{}} 140. Abundances in stars with very low metallicities will vary depending on the type of SN contributing to the local region of star formation. A time scale of {\~{}}107 yr is much shorter than the 108 yr time usually associated with processes in the galaxy and with the last time of r-process injection accounting for 129I, but may be compatible with the rate of SN occurrence. The hypothesis of a nearby SN polluting the protosolar nebula is critically discussed.},

abstract = {In a series of experiments at the SISSI/LISE3 facility of GANIL conducted between 1999 and 2004, we have collected decay information for proton-rich nuclei between 36Ca and 56Zn. The data allowed us to study the decay properties of 26 nuclei. The main experimental information obtained for all nuclei is their $\beta$-decay half-life and their total $\beta$-delayed proton emission branching ratio. For many nuclei, individual proton groups and $\gamma$ rays were identified and allowed us to establish first partial decay schemes for some of the nuclei studied. In addition, mass-excess values have been determined for some of the nuclei by means of the isobaric multiplet mass equation. For 50Ni, the decay via $\beta$-delayed two-proton emission could be tentatively identified. The decay of 49Ni allowed for the first time to identify the first 2+ state in 48Fe. The experimental data are confronted to model predictions for the half-life and the mass-excess values. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {For modes of electroweak decay such as electron capture and internal conversion, the spatial distribution of the electron cloud of the atom plays a major role in the decay probability. By successively removing electrons from these systems the decay probability is altered, thus chang- ing the transition rates. In some cases, this can increase or decrease the decay rates by several orders of magnitude. These effects are particularily important in hot, ionizing, astrophysical en- vironments. Due to significant technical challenges of generating and storing highly charged ions (HCIs), studies on these decay modes for HCIs are rare. With the commissioning of the TITAN decay spectroscopy setup at TRIUMF, nuclear decay properties of HCIs can now be studied in ion-traps for the first time. This proceeding reports the technical upgrade of the high-voltage infrastructure to provide access to increasingly ionized radioactive ions for decay study.},

In both steady-state nuclear burning appropriate for rapidly accreting neutron stars (such as the magnetic polar caps of accreting x-ray pulsars) and unstable burning of type I x-ray bursts, we find that the rp process ends in a closed SnSbTe cycle.

abstract = {We present nuclear reaction network calculations to investigate the influence of nuclear structure on the rp-process between Ge and Sn in various scenarios. Due to the lack of experimental data for neutron-deficient nuclei in this region, we discuss currently available model predictions for nuclear masses and deformations as well as methods of calculating reaction rates (Hauser-Feshbach) and $\beta$-decay rates (QRPA and shell model). In addition, we apply a valence nucleon (NpNn) correlation scheme for the prediction of masses and deformations. We also describe the calculations of 2p-capture reactions, which had not been considered before in this mass region. We find that in X-ray bursts 2p-capture reactions accelerate the reaction flow into the Z ≥ 36 region considerably. Therefore, the rp-process in most X-ray bursts does not end in the Z = 32–36 region as previously assumed and overproduction factors of 107–108 are reached for some light p-nuclei in the A = 80–100 region. This might be of interest in respect of the yet unexplained large observed solar system abundances of these nuclei. Nuclei in this region can also be produced via the rp-proces in accretion disks around low mass black holes. Our results indicate that the rp-process energy production in the Z {\textgreater} 32 region cannot be neglected in these scenarios. We discuss in detail the influence of the various nuclear structure input parameters and their current uncertainties on these results. It turns out that rp-process nucleosynthesis is mainly determined by nuclear masses and $\beta$-decay rates of nuclei along the proton drip line. We present a detailed list of nuclei for which mass or $\beta$-decay rate measurements would be crucial to further constrain the models.},

Therefore, the relevant nuclear physics data can be determined by experiments. With this rather reliable data basis, s-process nucleosynthesis offers an important testground of models for the late stages of stellar evolution, which are supposed to be the s-process site. The empirical counterpart for such models is the so-called classical s-process, a purely phenomenological picture, that is successfully used to derive the resulting abundances as well as information on the physical conditions during the s-process. The status of this classical approach is reviewed with emphasis on the implications for various stellar models of the s-process and in the light of results obtained by stellar spectroscopy. A brief account of the potential s-process chronometers is also presented.},

The new forces underlying these models are fitted respectively to three different realistic equations of state of neutron matter for which the density dependence of the symmetry energy ranges from the very soft to the very stiff, reflecting thereby our present lack of complete knowledge of the high-density behavior of nuclear matter. All unphysical instabilities of nuclear matter, including the transition to a polarized state in neutron-star matter, are eliminated with the new forces. At the same time the new models fit essentially all the available mass data with rms deviations of 0.58 MeV and give the same high-quality fits to measured charge radii that we obtained in earlier models with conventional Skyrme forces. Being constrained by neutron matter, these new mass models, which all give similar extrapolations out to the neutron drip line, are highly appropriate for studies of the r process and the outer crust of neutron stars. Moreover, the underlying forces, labeled BSk19, BSk20 and BSk21, respectively, are well adapted to the study of the inner crust and core of neutron stars. The new family of Skyrme forces thus opens the way to a unified description of all regions of neutron stars.},

abstract = {Permanent magnetic materials are the only magnetic source that can be used to generate magnetic fields without power consumption or maintenance. Such stand-alone magnets are very attractive for many scientific and engineering areas, but they suffer from poor temporal field stability, which arises from the strong sensitivity of the magnetic materials and mechanical support to temperature variation. In this work, we describe a highly efficient method useful to cancel the temperature coefficient of permanent magnet assemblies in a passive and accurate way. It is based on the combination of at least two units made of magnetic materials with different temperature coefficients arranged in such a way that the ratio of the fields generated by each unit matches the ratio of their effective temperature coefficients defined by both the magnetic and mechanical contributions. Although typically available magnetic materials have negative temperature coefficients, the cancellation is achieved by aligning the fields generated by each unit in the opposite direction. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by stabilizing the field generated by a dipolar Halbach magnet, recently proposed to achieve high field homogeneity. Both the field drift and the homogeneity are monitored via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments. The results demonstrate the compatibility of the thermal compensation approach with existing strategies useful to fine-tune the spatial dependence of the field generated by permanent magnet arrays.},

abstract = {Penning trap mass spectrometry (PTMS) can be used to test the Standard Model (SM) and to answer the questions related to the origin and abundance of the elements in the universe. There are several facilities worldwide specialized in PTMS and some of them can measure the masses of isotopes with half-lives in the range of milliseconds. TRIUMF's ion trap for atomic and nuclear science (TITAN) is one such facility. In mass measurement the precision is linearly proportional to the charge state of the ion of interest. To increase the charge state, ions are charge-bred using an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) at TITAN. This is a unique feature of the TITAN experimental facility. However, the charge breeding process introduces an energy spread among the ions which adversely affects the precision of the mass measurement and reduces the benefit of charge breeding. To overcome this problem a cooler Penning trap (CPET)was designed, assembled and is nowbeing tested off-line. This thesis presents the first systematic test results of CPET and the electron plasma behaviour that we observed. We also present the result of the first Penning trap mass measurement of the isotope 24Al, which is five times more precise than the previous atomic mass evaluation (AME2012) value. The precise and accurate mass of 24Al is important for both astrophysics and for tests of the standard model (SM). The resonance energy (Er) calculated for the 23Mg(p,$\gamma$)24Al reaction using the ground state mass of 24Al reported in this thesis shows a 2$\sigma$ deviation from the direct measurement. Tests of the SM by evaluating ft values using isospin T = 1 nuclides have reached a high precision level. The origin of the dominant uncertainty is now theoretical. Effort is now shifting towards the T =2 nuclides, which are far from the stability compared to their T =1 counterparts which make them better candidates for the test of the SM. For this reason, the ground state masses of T = 2 nuclides and of their decay products are required to be known with high precision. 24Al is the daughter of one such nucleus, 24Si. Once the beta decay branching ratio is measured precisely enough, the ground state mass of 24Al reported in this thesis will be useful to test the SM. The measurement was possible due to the recent development of TRIUMF's Ion Guide Laser Ion Source (IG-LIS) which reduced the background by a factor of '106.},

abstract = {Ion charge breeding for Penning-trap mass spectrometry has been established as providing a precision increase that scales linearly with the charge state of the ion. Fast and efficient charge breeding is a precondition for the application of this approach to rare isotopes. However, in view of low yields and short half-lives the precision boost is partly compromised by unavoidable ion losses inherent to the charge breeding process. The mass spectrometer TRIUMFs ion trap for atomic and nuclear science is pioneering this field by coupling a Penning trap and an electron beam ion trap to the rare-isotope beam facility ISAC at TRIUMF. Here we present simulations that calculate and maximize the effective precision gain of time-of-flight ion-cyclotron-resonance measurements with highly charged ions of short-lived nuclides. In addition we compare the characteristics of measurements with singly and highly charged ions, and we summarize recent results that explored benefits of charge breeding that go},

abstract = {A novel approach to mass measurements at the 10−9 level for short-lived nuclides with half-lives well below one second is presented. It is based on the projection of the radial ion motion in a Penning trap onto a position-sensitive detector. Compared with the presently employed time-of-flight ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, the novel approach is 25-times faster and provides a 40-fold gain in resolving power. Moreover, it offers a substantially higher sensitivity since just two ions are sufficient to determine the ion's cyclotron frequency. Systematic effects specific to the technique that can change the measured cyclotron frequency are considered in detail. It is shown that the main factors that limit the maximal accuracy and resolving power of the technique are collisions of the stored ions with residual gas in the trap, the temporal instability of the trapping voltage, the anharmonicities of the trapping potential and the uncertainty introduced by the conversion of the cyclotron to magnetron motion.},

abstract = {A new critical survey is presented of all half-life, decay-energy and branching-ratio measurements related to 20 superallowed 0+ --{\textgreater} 0+ beta decays. Included are 222 individual measurements of comparable precision obtained from 177 published references. Compared with our last review in 2008, we have added results from 24 new publications and eliminated 9 references, the results from which having been superseded by much more precise modern data. We obtain world-average ft-values for each of the eighteen transitions that have a complete set of data, then apply radiative and isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections to extract corrected Ft values. Fourteen of these Ft values now have a precision of order 0.1{\%} or better. In the process of obtaining these results we carefully evaluate the available calculations of the isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections by testing the extent to which they lead to Ft values consistent with conservation of the vector current (CVC). Only one set of calculations satisfactorily meets this condition. The resultant average Ft value, when combined with the muon liftime, yields the up-down quark-mixing element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, Vud = 0.97417 +/- 0.00021. The unitarity test on the top row of the matrix becomes |Vud|{\^{}}2 + |Vus|{\^{}}2 + |Vub|{\^{}}2 = 0.99978 +/- 0.00055 if the Particle Data Group recommended value for Vus is used. However, recent lattice QCD calculations, not included yet in the PDG evaluation, have introduced some inconsistency into kaon-decay measurements of Vus and Vus/Vud. We examine the impact of these new results on the unitarity test and conclude that there is no evidence of any statistically significant violation of unitarity. Finally, from the Ft-value data we also set limits on the possible existence of scalar interactions.},

From the stability diagram obtained for the circular rod quadrupole, it is shown that the resolution of an analyser with circular rod electrodes will largely be limited owing to a blunted tip on the stability diagram and the increase of the width of the stable region for a scan line.},

Yet the rapid pace of scientific and technological development today is such that any book on experimental technique must be wary of becoming ob­ solete in some way or another even in such a short span of time. Thus, when the publisher Springer-Verlag informed me of the need for a new printing of this book, I decided it was an opportune moment to update some of the chapters as well as to include some new material. The result is this second edition. The most notable changes have been in Chapters 2 and 3. In the latter, which con­ cerns radiation protection, most of the sections have been rewritten to take into account the new recommendations from the International Commission on Radiation Protection, the most important of which are the new dose limits for exposure to ionizing radiation. In addition, emphasis has now been put on the use of SI units in dosimetry, i.e., the Gray and Sievert, which have now become standard.},

A key result of these studies has been to point out the importance of individual neutron capture rates in setting the final r-process abundance pattern for a ‘main' (A ∼ 130 peak and above) r process. Here we examine neutron capture in the context of a ‘weak' r process that forms primarily the A ∼ 80 r-process abundance peak. We identify the astrophysical conditions required to produce this peak region through weak r-processing and point out the neutron capture rates that most strongly influence the final abundance pattern.},

abstract = {Spectroscopy of excited states of proton-rich nuclei has advanced considerably in recent years. This is due to recent experimental developments in the identification of nuclei produced with very low cross sections. In parallel, state-of-the-art shell-model calculations have become available which describe with very good accuracy the structure of medium-light nuclei. In this review, the focus is placed on the energy differences between isobaric analogue states - specifically T = frac(1, 2) isobaric doublets and T = 1 isobaric triplets in the region of nuclei between A ??? 30 and A ??? 60. Energy differences are interpreted in terms of a number of Coulomb and isospin non-conserving nuclear phenomena which, in turn, are investigated in the large-scale shell model. Remarkable agreement between the shell model and the data is achieved, which has resulted in a detailed understanding of the evolution of nuclear structure along the nuclear yrast line. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Previous investigations, making use of nuclear mass predictions from global macroscopic-microscopic models, showed abundance deficiencies around A ???- 120 and 140, indicating an overly strong N = 82 strength(some models also showed problems around A ???- 180 related to the N = 126 shell). In this paper we calculate masses based on Skyrme interactions locally around N = 82, within the HF+BCS method with the SIII interaction and the HFB theory with SkP interaction. The shell-quenching obtained in the latter approach results in a considerable improvement of the global Nr,??? fit, indicating a solution to a puzzle existing in r-process nucleosynthesis. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Half of the elements heavier than iron (Z{\textgreater}26) are thought to be created through the astrophysical r process, whereby nuclides are produced via a rapid series of nuclear reactions that are postulated to occur in high temperature and neutron density environments such as supernovae or merging neutron stars. The nucleosynthetic path that describes the sequence of reactions through the chart of nuclides strongly depends on the neutron-separation energies of the nuclei. Until recently, however, almost all of these neutron-rich nuclei were not within reach of accelerator facilities, and therefore simulations of the r process had to rely on mass models for input into the calculations. Now, with the advent of facilities such as CARIBU at Argonne National Laboratory, the masses of many nuclides along the r-process path can be determined precisely with Penning trap mass spectrometers coupled to these facilities. More than 70 nuclides have been measured with the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer alone in the past year, which overlap and complement results from other Penning trap mass spectrometers, and first calculations with these new masses suggest the timescale of the r process through the tin isotopes is delayed much more strongly than mass models would suggest. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

This MR-TOF-MS will also enable mass measurements of very short-lived nuclides (half-life {\textgreater} 1 ms) that are produced in very low quantities (a few detected ions overall). In order to allow the installation of an MR-TOF-MS in the restricted space on the platform, on which the TITAN facility is located, novel mass spectrometric methods have been developed. Transport, cooling and distribution of the ions inside the device is done using a buffer gas-filled RFQ-based ion beam switchyard. Mass selection is achieved using a dynamic retrapping technique after time-of-flight analysis in an electrostatic isochronous reflector system. Only due to the combination of these novel methods the realization of an MR-TOF-MS based isobar separator at TITAN has become possible. The device has been built, commissioned off-line and is currently under installation at TITAN.},

abstract = {As the base unit of time interval, the second holds a place of preeminence in the world of metrology. Time interval, and its reciprocal, frequency, can be measured with more resolution and less uncertainty than any of the other physical quantities. The precise realization of the second was made possible by the development of frequency standards based on the energy transitions of atoms, an event that not only revolutionized the science of timekeeping, but also forever changed many other areas of metrology. The definitions of other units in the international system (SI), including the meter, candela, ampere, and volt, now depend upon the definition of the second. In the approximate half century since atomic frequency standards were first introduced, the progress in time and frequency metrology has been rapid and relentless. Today, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), maintains the world's most accurate primary frequency standard, a laser-cooled cesium fountain known as NIST-F1. Since its completion in 1998, NIST-F1 has been continuously improved and is currently accurate to within 4 × 10-16. NIST-F2, a second-generation atomic fountain standard now being built, promises even better accuracy. This paper explores both the history and the technology of NIST primary frequency standards, beginning in the pre-atomic era and continuing through the present day.},

@article{Bethe1936,
abstract = {Experiments on slow neutrons, and theoretical considerations of Bohr have shown that heavy nuclei possess an enormous number of energy levels which are very closely spaced if the nucleus is highly excited. A crude method is suggested for calculating the spacing between these levels. The method is statistical: The individual nuclear particles are supposed to move in a simple potential hole, and the energy of the complete nucleus is supposed to be the sum of the energies of the individual particles. A critical discussion of these assumptions is given in section 5. The problem then reduces itself to the calculation of the "entropy" of a Fermi gas containing a given number of particles A and having a given excitation energy Q above the zero point energy of the Fermi gas (cf. section 2 and 3). This calculation gives the total number of levels of the complete nucleus in a given energy interval irrespective of the angular momentum, which will, for most of the levels, be very large. For the theory of neutron capture, it is necessary to calculate the density of nuclear levels with a given angular momentum I (section 4). The spacing of nuclear levels is found to depend on the product of the mass number A and the excitation energy Q of the nucleus, and to be roughly given by {\{}$\Delta$=4.1{\textperiodcentered}106x4e-x/(2I+1) volts{\}}{\{}x,=(AQ)1/2/2.20,{\}} Q being expressed in MV and I being the nuclear spin. For the capture of slow neutrons by nuclei of medium weight (A around 100), $\Delta$ is of the order 50 to 500 volts. The spacing between adjacent levels decreases rapidly with increasing atomic weight. For given atomic weight, the spacing of the nuclear levels responsible for neutron capture is wider if the capture leads to the formation of a radioactive nucleus than if a stable nucleus is formed. This explains the experimental fact that only moderately large cross sections are found for the capture of thermal neutrons leading to radioactive nuclei while the very largest cross sections are all connected with the formation of stable nuclei. The dependence of the spacing on various factors is discussed (section 6); the results seem to be in qualitative agreement with experiment.},

This damping is attributed to the perturbed magnetic field and is similar to the stabilization of sausage and kink modes in neutral plasmas. The damping rate for this case is compared with the damping observed in the University of California, Irvine (UCI) modified Betatron.

abstract = {This thesis details the precision mass measurements of 33 neutron-rich ground-state nuclei and isomeric states that approach or lie on the proposed rapid neutron capture process (r-process) path. For many of the nuclei measured the work presented here will be the rst direct mass measurements of these nuclei, including 130In, 137Sb, 133I, and 134I. The measurements were made using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer (CPT), located at the ATLAS heavy ion-linac at Argonne National Laboratory. Ground states and isomers have been measured with the CPT at precisions (m=m) between 107, and 108. The nuclei were produced at the new CAlifornium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) to ATLAS. Because nuclear masses are required for measuring neutron separation energies, and neutron separation energies are important inputs in r-process network calculations, precision mass measurements are critical for advancing our knowledge of the r-process. This thesis will give the astrophysical motivation for making these mass measurements, the theoretical background behind ion trapping and mass measurements using ion traps, an explanation of the CPT apparatus, the mass measurements themselves, and the results of those measurements as they pertain to r-process network calculations. Results of these mass measurements show signi cant shifts in the r-process path over a range of temperatures and neutron densities.},

abstract = {Ion motion in a Penning trap and the electrical signals it can produce have been analyzed for the purpose of identifying the important causes of uncertainty in high‐accuracy mass measurements of heavy ions. The role of the azimuthal quadrupole electric field in signal pickup, and its effects on ion motion at the sum frequency of the cyclotron and magnetron motions, have been identified. A useful scheme for calculating the signal strength and strength of the interaction between an applied field and the ion motion has been developed. The important sources of uncertainty in using the sum frequency of the cyclotron and magnetron motions for determining the ion mass are discussed. Particular application is made to the case of cyclotron resonance detection by observation of the time of flight of ejected ions.},

abstract = {We present a review of the possible sources for r-process nuclei (r-nuclei). It is known that there is as yet no self-consistent mechanism to provide abundant neutrons for a robust r-process in the neutrino-driven winds from nascent neutron stars. We consider that the heavy r-nuclei with mass numbers A{\textgreater}130 (Ba and above) cannot be produced in the neutrino-driven winds. Nonetheless, the r-process and the neutrino-driven winds may be directly or indirectly related by some unknown additional mechanism, which, for example, could provide ejecta with very short dynamic timescales of View the MathML source. This undetermined mechanism must supply a neutron source within the same general stellar sites that undergo core collapse to produce the neutron star. Observational data on low-metallicity stars in the Galactic halo show that sites producing the heavy r-nuclei do not produce Fe or any other elements between N and Ge. Insofar as a forming neutron star is key to producing the heavy r-nuclei, then the only possible sources are supernovae resulting from collapse of O–Ne–Mg cores or accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs, neither of which produce the elements of the Fe group or those of intermediate mass (above C and N). Observational evidence on s and r-nuclei in low-metallicity stars with high C and N abundances shows that the r-process is also active in binary systems. The nuclei with Anot, vert, similar90–110 produced by charged-particle reactions (CPR) in the neutrino-driven winds are in general present in metal-poor stars with high or low abundances of heavy r-nuclei. The CPR nuclei and the heavy r-nuclei are not strongly coupled. Some metal-poor stars show extremely high enrichments of heavy r-nuclei and have established that the abundance patterns of these nuclei are universally close to the solar abundance pattern of heavy r-nuclei. Using a template star with high enrichments of heavy r-nuclei and another with low enrichments we develop a two-component model based on the abundances of Eu (from sources for heavy r-nuclei) and Fe (from Fe core-collapse supernovae). This model gives very good quantitative predictions for the abundances of all the other elements in those metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]less, approximate-1.5 for which the Eu and Fe abundances are known. We attribute the CPR elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr to reactions in the neutrino-driven winds from a nascent neutron star and the heavy r-nuclei to the hypothecated true “r-process”. The CPR nuclei should be produced whenever a neutron star is formed regardless of whether heavy r-nuclei are produced or not. Using the two-component model we estimate the yield of the CPR element Sr to be not, vert, similar10-6Mcircled dot operator for a single neutron star formation event. Self-consistent astrophysical models are needed to establish that the CPR nuclei are common to the neutron stars produced in both sources for the heavy r-nuclei and those for Fe. We show that the observational data appear fully consistent with the two-component model. The specific mechanism and site for the production of heavy r-nuclei remains to be found.},

The main principles of electromagnetic confinement of various species from elementary particles to heavy atoms are briefly described. The preparation and manipulation with trapped single particles, as well as methods of frequency measurements, providing unprecedented precision, are discussed. Unique applications of Penning traps in fundamental physics are presented. Ultra-precise trap-measurements of masses and magnetic moments of elementary particles (electrons, positrons, protons and antiprotons) confirm CPT-conservation, and allow accurate determination of the fine-structure constant agr and other fundamental constants. This together with the information on the unitarity of the quark-mixing matrix, derived from the trap-measurements of atomic masses, serves for assessment of the Standard Model of the physics world. Direct mass measurements of nuclides targeted to some advanced problems of astrophysics and nuclear physics are also presented.},

abstract = {The use of highly charged ions increases the precision and resolving power, in particular for short-lived species produced at on-line radio-isotope beam facilities, achievablewith Penning trap mass spectrometers. This increase in resolving power provides a new and unique access to resolving low-lying long-lived (T1/2 {\textgreater} 50 ms) nuclear isomers.Recently, the 111.19(22) keV(determined from $\gamma$ -ray spectroscopy) isomeric state in 78Rbwas resolved from the ground state, in a charge state of q = 8+ with the TRIUMF Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science at the TRIUMF's Isotope Separator and Accelerator facility. The excitation energy of the isomer was measured to be 108.7(6.4) keV above the ground state. The extracted masses for both the ground and isomeric states, and their difference, agree with the AME2003 and Nuclear Data Sheet values. This proof of principle measurement demonstrates the feasibility of using Penning trap mass spectrometers coupled to charge breeders to study nuclear isomers and opens a new route for isomer searches.

abstract = {Context. A recent survey of a large sample of Galactic intermediate-mass$\backslash$n({\{}$\backslash$gt{\}}3 M{\_}{\{}{\&}sun;{\}}) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars shows that$\backslash$nthey exhibit large overabundances of rubidium (Rb) up to 100-1000 times$\backslash$nsolar. In contrast, zirconium (Zr) is not enriched in these stars$\backslash$ncompared to its solar abundances. These observations set constraints on$\backslash$nour theoretical notion of the slow neutron capture process (s process)$\backslash$nthat occurs inside intermediate-mass AGB stars. Lithium (Li) abundances$\backslash$nare also reported for these stars. In intermediate-mass AGB stars, Li$\backslash$ncan be produced by proton captures occuring at the base of the$\backslash$nconvective envelope. For this reason the observations of Rb, Zr, and Li$\backslash$nset complementary constraints on different processes occurring in the$\backslash$nsame stars. Aims: We present predictions for the abundances of$\backslash$nRb, Zr, and Li as computed for the first time simultaneously in$\backslash$nintermediate-mass AGB star models and compare them to the current$\backslash$nobservational constraints. Methods: We calculate the Rb, Zr, and$\backslash$nLi surface abundances for stellar models with masses between 3 and 6.5$\backslash$nM{\_}{\{}{\&}sun;{\}} and metallicities between 0.02 and 0.004. $\backslash$nResults: We find that the Rb abundance increases with increasing stellar$\backslash$nmass, as is inferred from observations but we are unable to match the$\backslash$nhighest observed [Rb/Fe] abundances. Variations of the reaction rates of$\backslash$nthe neutron-capture cross sections involved with Rb production and the$\backslash$nrate of the {\^{}}{\{}22{\}}Ne({\{}$\alpha${\}},n){\^{}}{\{}25{\}}Mg reaction,$\backslash$nresponsible for neutron production inside these stars, yield only modest$\backslash$nvariations in the surface Rb content of {\{}$\backslash$ap{\}}0.3 dex. Inclusion of a$\backslash$npartial mixing zone (PMZ) to activate the$\backslash$n{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}C({\{}$\alpha${\}},n){\^{}}{\{}16{\}}O reaction as an additional$\backslash$nneutron source yields significant enhancements in the Rb abundance.$\backslash$nHowever this leads to Zr abundances that exceed the upper limits of the$\backslash$ncurrent observational constraints. If the third dredge-up (TDU)$\backslash$nefficiency remains as high during the final stages of AGB evolution as$\backslash$nduring the earlier stages, we can match the lowest values of the$\backslash$nobserved Rb abundance range. We predict large variations in the Li$\backslash$nabundance, which are observed. Finally, the predicted Rb production$\backslash$nincreases with decreasing metallicity, in qualitative agreement with$\backslash$nobservations of Magellanic Cloud AGB stars. However stellar models of Z$\backslash$n= 0.008 and Z = 0.004 intermediate-mass AGB stars do not produce enough$\backslash$nRb to match the observed abundances.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {A new signal processing method has been proposed for generating optimal stored wave form inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) excitation signals used in Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS or FT‐ICR). The excitation wave forms with desired flat excitation power can be obtained by using the data processing steps which include: (1) smoothing of the specified magnitude spectrum, (2) generation of the optimal phase function, and (3) inverse Fourier transformation. In contrast to previously used procedures, no time domain wave form apodization is necessary. The optimal phase functions can be expressed as an integration of the specified power spectral profiles. This allows one not only to calculate optimal phase functions in discrete data format, but also to obtain an analytical expression (in simple magnitude spectral cases) that is for theoretical studies. A comparison is made of the frequency sweeping or ‘‘chirp'' excitation and stored wave form inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) excitation. This shows that chirp excitation and SWIFT excitation with a square magnitude spectrum and a quadratic phase are counterparts of the Fourier transformation. Therefore, the results of theoretical work on chirp excitation can be used for the analysis of the time domain excitation wave forms in the SWIFT technique.},

Ideally complementing a theoretically-oriented textbook on nuclear physics and/or particle physics, it introduces the reader to the different techniques used in nuclear and particle physics to accelerate particles and to measurement techniques (detectors) in nuclear and particle physics. The main subjects treated are: interactions of subatomic particles in matter; particle accelerators; basics of different types of detectors; and nuclear electronics. The book will be of interest to undergraduates, graduates and researchers in both particle and nuclear physics. For the physicists it is a good introduction to all experimental aspects of nuclear and particle physics. Nuclear engineers will appreciate the nuclear measurement techniques, while biomedical engineers can learn about measuring ionising radiation, the use of accelerators for radiotherapy.

The beam passage inside the RFQCB has been simulated with an independent code to highlight the importance of the internal gas pressure, to motivate design changes in the new RFQCB and to explain ways to improve the performance of the current machine. The suspected misalignment of ISCOOL has been quantified, and, using a simulation of ions passing through the external injection electrodes, the effect of the misalignment on machine acceptance has been detailed.

abstract = {High precision mass measurements of unstable isotopes are important for many physical applications, especially in nuclear physics. To measure these masses, the setup of TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear Science (TITAN) at the Canadian Accelerator facility TRIUMF makes use of a Pen- ning Trap. Masses of unstable isotopes with half-lives down to 8ms have been determined with a precision of up to 1×10−8. However, for applications in nuclear particle physics, even higher precisions are needed. But the measurement precision with Penning traps is limited due to the short half-lives and/or the low production yields of the measured iso- topes. To overcome these limitations, an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT) charge breeder is used at TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear Science (TITAN), to create Highly Charged Ions (HCIs) for the purpose of Penning trap mass spectrometry. With the higher charge state of the isotope, a pre- cision gain of more than one order of magnitude or alternatively a significant reduction in measurement time can be achieved. The achievable precision, however, is limited by the quality of the ion beam used for Penning trap mass measurements. Due to the effects of charge breeding, the beam properties - quantifiable by the transversal emittance and longitudinal energy spread - are increased and reducing the gain in mea- surement precision. Therefore, it is important for TITAN to measure and optimize the beam properties of HCIs extracted from the TITAN EBIT. For this reason, an Allison emittance meter as well as a Retarding field analyzer were designed and built in the scope of this work, to measure the transversal emittance and the longitudinal energy spread, respectively. After the successful commissioning of the detectors, the properties of ex- tracted beams were measured to be ?rms = 5.27(73)$\pi$mmmrad for the emit- tance and ∆Ebeam = 19.7(21) eV/q for the longitudinal energy spread, using 85Rb of charge state 13+. In order to do precision mass measurements with HCIs, these values need to be reduced optimizing the charge breeding and ex- traction process. Further, it was found that the energy spread is dominated by the extraction mechanism of the ions, not by the used charge breeding mechanism. The detectors, as well as the measured values, are an important step towards high precision mass measurements of HCIs at TITAN.},

All nuclides for which some experimental information is known are considered. Nubase2012 covers all up to date experimental data published in primary (journal articles) and secondary (mainly laboratory reports and conference proceedings) references, together with the corresponding bibliographical information. During the development of Nubase2012, the data available in the "Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File" (Ensdf) database were consulted, and critically assessed of their validity and completeness. Furthermore, a large amount of new and somewhat older experimental results that were missing in Ensdf were compiled, evaluated and included in Nubase2012. The atomic mass values were taken from the "Atomic Mass Evaluation" (Ame2012, second and third parts of the present issue). In cases where no experimental data were available for a particular nuclide, trends in the behavior of specific properties in neighboring nuclei (TNN) were examined. This approach allowed to estimate, whenever possible, values for a range of properties, and are labeled in Nubase2012 as "non-experimental" (flagged "{\#}"). Evaluation procedures and policies that were used during the development of this database are presented, together with a detailed table of recommended values and their uncertainties.},

This paper briefly describes two small-animal SPECT systems that allow this flexibility and then presents a framework for evaluating adaptive systems in general, and adaptive SPECT systems in particular. The evaluation is in terms of the performance of linear observers on detection or estimation tasks. Expressions are derived for the ideal linear (Hotelling) observer and the ideal linear (Wiener) estimator with adaptive imaging. Detailed expressions for the performance figures of merit are given, and possible adaptation rules are discussed.},

abstract = {The success of many measurements in analytical mass spectrometry as well as in precision mass determinations for atomic and nuclear physics is handicapped when the ion sources deliver "contaminations", i.e., unwanted ions of masses similar to those of the ions of interest. In particular, in ion-trapping devices, large amounts of contaminant ions result in significant systematic errors-if the measurements are possible at all. We present a solution for such cases: The ions from a quasi-continuous source are bunched in a linear radio-frequency-quadrupole ion trap, separated by a multi-reflection time-of-flight section followed by a Bradbury-Nielsen gate, and then captured in a Penning trap. Buffer-gas cooling is used to damp the ion motion in the latter, which allows a repeated opening of the Penning trap for a stacking of mass-selected ion bunches. Proof-of-principle demonstrations have been performed with the ISOLTRAP setup at ISOLDE/CERN, both with 133Cs+ ions from an off-line ion source and by application to an on-line beam of 179Lu+ ions contaminated with 163Dy16O+ ions. In addition, an optimization of the experimental procedure is given, in particular for the number of ion bunches captured as a function of the ions' lifetimes and the parameters of the experiment . {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

An 8+ two-quasiparticle isomer has been populated both in the fragmentation of a 136Xe beam as well as in projectile fission of 238U, making 130Cd the most neutron-rich N=82 isotone for which information about excited states is available. The results, interpreted using state-of-the-art nuclear shell-model calculations, show no evidence of an N=82 shell quenching at Z=48. They allow us to follow nuclear isomerism throughout a full major neutron shell from 98Cd50 to 130Cd82 and reveal, in comparison with 76Ni48 one major proton shell below, an apparently abnormal scaling of nuclear two-body interactions.},

abstract = {The precision of atomic mass measurements in a Penning trap is directly proportional to the charge state q of the ion and, hence, can be increased by using highly charged ions (HCI). For this reason, charge breeding with an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) is employed at TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) on-line facility in Vancouver, Canada. By bombarding the injected and trapped singly charged ions with an intense beam of electrons, the charge state of the ions is rapidly increased inside the EBIT. To be compatible with the on-line requirements of short-lived isotopes, very high electron beam current densities are needed. The TITAN EBIT includes a 6 Tesla superconducting magnet and is designed to have electron beam currents and energies of up to 5 A and 60 keV, respectively. Once operational at full capacity, most species can be bred into a He-like configuration within tens of ms. Subsequently, the HCI are extracted, pass a Wien filter to reduce isobaric contamination, are cooled, and injected into a precision Penning trap for mass measurement. We will present the first results and current status of the TITAN EBIT, which has recently been moved to TRIUMF after assembly and commissioning at the Max-Planck-Institute (MPI) for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany.},

abstract = {A direct Q-value measurement has been made at TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear Science (TITAN) for the Cr51(e−,$\nu$e)V51 reaction. This electron capture (EC) reaction was used in calibration measurements at the solar neutrino experiments SAGE and GALLEX, and the observed event rate differed from predictions creating the so-called gallium anomaly. Using isotopes delivered by the Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) facility at TRIUMF and charge breeding them to charge states 5+ and 6+, a Q value of 751.86(55) keV was determined. This represents a 1.3$\sigma$ deviation from the result in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2012 (AME12) and the value used in the calculated event rate. This deviation is found to be insignificant in context of the gallium anomaly, thus confirming that the predicted event rate has not been overestimated as the result of an erroneous Cr51 EC Q value. Additionally, the absolute masses of each Cr51 and V51 have been independently determined and are in agreement with the AME12 values.},

abstract = {Because of scarcity of photons emitted from the heart, clinical cardiac SPECT imaging is mainly limited by photon statistics. The sub-optimal detection efficiency of current SPECT systems not only limits the quality of clinical cardiac SPECT imaging but also makes more advanced potential applications difficult to be realized. We propose a high-performance system platform - C-SPECT, which has its sampling geometry optimized for detection of emitted photons in quality and quantity. The C-SPECT has a stationary C-shaped gantry that surrounds the left-front side of a patient's thorax. The stationary C-shaped collimator and detector systems in the gantry provide effective and efficient detection and sampling of photon emission. For cardiac imaging, the C-SPECT platform could achieve 2 to 4 times the system geometric efficiency of conventional SPECT systems at the same sampling resolution. This platform also includes an integrated transmission CT for attenuation correction. The ability of C-SPECT systems to perform sequential high-quality emission and transmission imaging could bring cost-effective high-performance to clinical imaging. In addition, a C-SPECT system could provide high detection efficiency to accommodate fast acquisition rate for gated and dynamic cardiac imaging. This paper describes the design concepts and performance potential of C-SPECT, and illustrates how these concepts can be implemented in a basic system.},

Of the nuclear data sets needed for r-process simulations—masses, {\$}\backslashbeta {\$}-decay rates, {\$}\backslashbeta {\$}-delayed neutron emission probabilities, neutron capture rates, fission probabilities and daughter product distributions, neutrino interaction rates—masses are arguably the most important, because they are a key ingredient in the calculations of all other theoretical quantities. Here, we investigate how uncertainties in nuclear masses translate into uncertainties in the final abundance pattern produced in r-process simulations. We examine the influence of individual mass variations on three types of r-process simulations—a hot wind, cold wind, and neutron star merger r process—with markedly different r-process paths and resulting final abundance patterns. We find the uncertainties in the abundance patterns due to the mass variations exceed the differences due to the astrophysics. This situation can be improved, however, by even modest reductions in mass uncertainties.},

Recently, a similar effect was discovered in other finite fermion systems, such as ultrasmall metallic grains and metal clusters. It is believed that the staggering in nuclei and grains is primarily due to pairing correlations (superconductivity), while in clusters it is caused by the Jahn-Teller effect. We find that, for light and medium-mass nuclei, the staggering has two components. The first one originates from pairing while the second, comparable in magnitude, has its roots in the deformed mean field.},

abstract = {Large star-to-star variations of the abundances of proton-capture elements, such as Na and O, in globular clusters (GCs) are interpreted as the effect of internal pollution resulting from the presence of multiple stellar populations. To better constrain this scenario, we investigate the abundance distribution of the heavy element rubidium (Rb) in NGC 6752, NGC 1904, and NGC 104 (47 Tuc). Combining the results from our sample with those in the literature, we found that Rb exhibits no star-to-star variations, regardless of cluster metallicity, with the possible intriguing, although very uncertain, exception of the metal-rich bulge cluster NGC 6388. If no star-to-star variations can be confirmed for all GCs, this finding implies that the stellar source of the proton-capture element variations must not have produced significant amounts of Rb. This element is observed to be enhanced at extremely high levels in intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (IM-AGB) stars in the Magellanic Clouds (i.e., at a metallicity similar to 47 Tuc and NGC 6388). This fact may present a challenge to this popular candidate polluter, unless the mass range of the observed IM-AGB stars does not participate in the formation of the second-generation stars in GCs. A number of possible solutions are available to resolve this conundrum, including the fact that the Magellanic Cloud observations are very uncertain and may need to be revised. The fast rotating massive stars scenario would not face this potential problem as the slow mechanical winds of these stars during their main-sequence phase do not carry any Rb enhancements; however, these candidates face even bigger issues such as the production of Li and the close overlap with core-collapse supernova timescales. Observations of Sr, Rb, and Zr in metal-rich clusters such as NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 are sorely needed to clarify the situation.},

The first 12 years of AD operation saw cold View the MathML sourceH¯ synthesized by overlapping clouds of positrons (e+e+) and antiprotons (View the MathML sourcep¯) confined in magnetic Penning traps. Cold View the MathML sourceH¯ was also produced in collisions between Rydberg positronium (PsPs) atoms and View the MathML sourcep¯. Ground-state View the MathML sourceH¯ was later trapped for up to ∼1000 s in a magnetic bottle trap, and microwave transitions excited between its hyperfine levels. In the View the MathML sourcep¯He+ atom, deep ultraviolet transitions were measured to a fractional precision of (2.3–5)×10−9 by sub-Doppler two-photon laser spectroscopy. From this the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio was determined as View the MathML sourceMp¯/me=1836.1526736(23), which agrees with the pp value known to a similar precision. Microwave spectroscopy of View the MathML sourcep¯He+ yielded a measurement of the View the MathML sourcep¯ magnetic moment with a precision of 0.3{\%}. More recently, the magnetic moment of a single View the MathML sourcep¯ confined in a Penning trap was measured with a higher precision, as View the MathML source$\mu$p¯=−2.792845(12)$\mu$nucl in nuclear magnetons.

@phdthesis{Gallant2015,
abstract = {Recent theoretical studies have shown that three-nucleon forces are important for understand- ing neutron-rich nuclei, and for the formation of nuclear shell structure. In particular, theory can not reproduce the N = 28 magic number in ⁴⁸Ca using two-body interactions. This magic number is only reproduced with the inclusion of three-nucleon forces. Further along the calcium isotopic chain, the three-nucleon interaction predicts new magic numbers at N = 32 and 34, while calculations with phenomenological interactions predict a magic number at N = 32, but disagree on the magicity of N = 34. An other theoretical tool that has been under significant pressure since the advent of precision mass measurements is the isobaric multiplet mass equation, in which the binding energies of states in an isobaric multiplet should vary quadratically with the z-projection of the isospin. This is a consequence of the isospin dependent component of the nuclear Hamiltonian and Coulomb interactions. We test the predictions of phenomenological and three-nucleon interactions through mass measurements of ²⁰'²¹Mg, ⁵¹'⁵²Ca, and ⁵¹K with the TITAN Penning trap mass spectrometer. The measured mass excesses were ME(²⁰Mg) = 17477.7(18) keV, ME(²¹Mg) = 10903.85(74) keV, ME(⁵¹Ca) = 36339(23) keV, ME(⁵²Ca) = 34245(61) keV, and ME(⁵¹K) = 22516(13) keV. With the calcium and potassium mass measurements, we show that the calculations with three-nucleon forces are able to correctly predict the two-neutron separation energies. In the A = 20 and 21 isobaric multiplets, neither the phenomenological nor the three-nucleon based interactions are able to reproduce the measured behaviour.},

The mass of 100Rb is determined for the first time. The studied nuclides mark the known low-Z frontier of the shape transition at N=60. To describe the shape evolution towards the krypton isotopic chain, a theoretical analysis is presented in the framework of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach. The importance of the pairing interaction for describing the extent and strength of the region of quadrupole deformation is emphasized. A later transition to large prolate deformation or, alternatively, the predominance of oblate deformation is proposed as explanation for the different behavior of the krypton isotopes. Octupole collectivity is explored as a possible mechanism for the evolution of two-neutron separation energies around N=56.},

abstract = {Neutrino-driven winds, which follow core-collapse supernova explosions, present a fascinating nuclear astrophysics problem that requires understanding advanced astrophysics simulations, the properties of matter and neutrino interactions under extreme conditions, the structure and reactions of exotic nuclei, and comparisons against forefront astronomical observations. The neutrino-driven wind has attracted vast attention over the last 20 years as it was suggested to be a candidate for the astrophysics site where half of the heavy elements are produced via the r-process. In this review, we summarize our present understanding of neutrino-driven winds from the dynamical and nucleosynthesis perspectives. Rapid progress has been made during recent years in understanding the wind with improved simulations and better micro physics. The current status of the fields is that hydrodynamical simulations do not reach the extreme conditions necessary for the r-process and the proton or neutron richness of the wind remains to be investigated in more detail. However, nucleosynthesis studies and observations point already to neutrino-driven winds to explain the origin of lighter heavy elements, such as Sr, Y, Zr.},

abstract = {The $\beta$-decay half-lives of 110 neutron-rich isotopes of the elements from Rb37 to Sn50 were measured at the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory. The 40 new half-lives follow robust systematics and highlight the persistence of shell effects. The new data have direct implications for r-process calculations and reinforce the notion that the second (A≈130) and the rare-earth-element (A≈160) abundance peaks may result from the freeze-out of an (n,$\gamma$)⇄($\gamma$,n) equilibrium. In such an equilibrium, the new half-lives are important factors determining the abundance of rare-earth elements, and allow for a more reliable discussion of the r process universality. It is anticipated that universality may not extend to the elements Sn, Sb, I, and Cs, making the detection of these elements in metal-poor stars of the utmost importance to determine the exact conditions of individual r-process events.},

abstract = {We discuss the building blocks for a consistent inclusion of chiral three-nucleon (3N) interactions into ab initio nuclear structure calculations beyond the lower p-shell. We highlight important technical developments, such as the similarity renormalization group (SRG) evolution in the 3N sector, a JT-coupled storage scheme for 3N matrix elements with efficient on-the-fly decoupling, and the importance truncated no-core shell model with 3N interactions. Together, these developments make converged ab initio calculations with explicit 3N interactions possible also beyond the lower p-shell. We analyze in detail the impact of various truncations of the SRG-evolved Hamiltonian, in particular the truncation of the harmonic-oscillator model space used for solving the SRG flow equations and the omission of the induced beyond-3N contributions of the evolved Hamiltonian. Both truncations lead to sizable effects in the upper p-shell and beyond and we present options to remedy these truncation effects. The analysis of the different truncations is a first step towards a systematic uncertainty quantification of all stages of the calculation.},

Both the above precisions are required at the neutron richness of A/Z = 3.0 at the N=82 shell closure and A/Z = 2.9 at the N=50 shell closure. For the doubly magic nuclide 78Ni, a precision of 1sigma {\~{}}{\textless} 300 keV and 1sigma {\~{}}{\textless} 5 ms are required, respectively, for mass and half-life measurements. This analysis aims to provide a first rough guide for ongoing detector developments.},

abstract = {Pixellated cadmium-zinc telluride (CZT) detectors, providing higher spatial resolution and energy resolution than current gamma cameras, will improve the image quality of SPECT detector systems. Their performance has to be evaluated in terms of resolution, detector efficiency and image quality in a similar way as has been done earlier for NaI detectors. We have developed an analytical model for spatial resolution and geometric efficiency of collimators specifically for pixellated CZT based detectors. We derive an exact description for a variety of static and rotating detector concepts, use standard performance criteria for detection efficiency, and adapt measures for spatial resolution of pixellated detectors, based on the sampling of the single pixel response function (SPRF). The concept is extended to enable a comparative description of continuous scintillator based SPECT cameras. Tradeoffs among resolution, efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and minimum detectable contrast have been investigated for different detector concepts. Our analysis shows that concepts using rotating collimators suffer from noise accumulation, except for purely hot spot imaging. A finite optimization of current SPECT systems can be done based on this analytical model, and a further increase in image quality will be achieved by the higher spatial resolution and energy resolution of solid-state detectors.},

Remarkably, this mechanism is found to act well beyond the h(11/2) shell.},

abstract = {The hyperfine structure of the odd-even 51−63Mn isotopes (N = 26 − 38) were mea- sured using bunched beam collinear laser spectroscopy with the COLLAPS experi- mental setup at ISOLDE, CERN. The properties of these nuclei were investigated over the course of two experiments. During the first experiment, nuclear spins and magnetic dipole moments were extacted from spectroscopy on manganese atoms. These nuclear properties were then compared to the predictions of two large-scale shell model effective interactions (GXPF1A [1, 2] and LNPS [3]) which use different model spaces. In the case of 61,63Mn, these results show the increasing importance of neutron excitations across the proposed N = 40 subshell closure, and of proton excitations across the Z = 28 shell gap. These measurements provide the first direct proof that proton and neutron excitations across shell gaps are playing an important role in the ground state wave functions of the neutron-rich Mn isotopes. The electric quadrupole moment provides complementary information to the mag- netic dipole moment, since it is able to directly probe the degree of collectivity and deformation in a nucleus, however sensitivity limitations during the first experiment prevented the quadrupole moments from being accurately determined. To overcome these limitations, it was necessary to find an electronic transition with sensitivity to the quadrupole interaction. A suitable transition was found in the ion from a metastable state and optical pumping in ISOLDE's cooler and buncher, ISCOOL, was used to populate this state for the second manganese experiment. This is the first use of the in-cooler optical pumping technique at ISOLDE, and required an overhaul of ISCOOL. During the second experiment, the spectroscopic quadrupole moments of the iso- topes were extracted from the measured hyperfine spectra of manganese ions. The sensitivity and spectroscopic efficiency were increased as compared to the atomic ex- periment. The extracted quadrupole moments were again compared to predictions from the GXPF1A and LNPS effective interactions. The inclusion of the 1 $\nu$g9/2 and 2 $\nu$d5/2 orbitals in the model space were shown to be necessary to reproduce the experimentally observed onset of quadrupole deformation.},

abstract = {The previously pioneered Isochronous Mass Spectrometry (IMS) has been extended by an additional precise magnetic-rigidity determination to enable accurate large-scale measurements of stored short-lived relativistic nuclei with the FRS-ESR facility at 382 MeV/u. With this novel experimental tool the mass resolving power and accuracy have been improved by a factor of about 3. The recorded broad-band revolution time spectrum corresponds to the mass-over-charge range of about 6{\%}. A mass resolving power of 200 000 (FWHM) and a typical accuracy of 120 keV have been achieved almost over the entire spectrum. The masses of 35 neutron-rich nuclides have been directly measured in the element range from aluminum to barium. The Masses of 8 nuclides (85,86As, 89Se, 123Ag, 138Te, 140,141I, 143Xe) have been measured for the first time. The results are compared with previous experimental data and theoretical predictions.

High-resolution comparisons of both systems provide sensitive tests of CPT symmetry, which is the most fundamental symmetry in the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. Any measured difference would point to CPT violation and thus to new physics. Here we report the development of an antihydrogen source using a cusp trap for in-flight spectroscopy. A total of 80 antihydrogen atoms are unambiguously detected 2.7 m downstream of the production region, where perturbing residual magnetic fields are small. This is a major step towards precision spectroscopy of the ground-state hyperfine splitting of antihydrogen using Rabi-like beam spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Masses of 238U projectile fragments have been measured with time-resolved Schottky Mass Spectrometry (SMS) at the FRS-ESR facility at GSI. The exotic nuclei were created in the production target at the entrance of the fragment separator FRS, spatially separated in flight and injected into the storage-cooler ring ESR at about 70{\%} light velocity. This means the ions were mainly bare or carried only a few electrons, e.g., the population of Li-like ions was below 1{\%} for Pt fragments. Accurate new mass values of 33 neutron-rich, stored exotic nuclei in the element range from platinum to uranium have been obtained for the first time. In total more than 150 nuclides including references with well-known masses have been covered in this large-area SMS measurement. A novel data analysis has been applied which reduces the systematic errors by taking into account the velocity profile of the cooler electrons and the residual ion-optical dispersion in this part of the storage ring. The experiment, the data analysis, and the mass values are presented. The experimental data are compared with theoretical predictions demonstrating systematic deviations of up to 1500 keV from modern mass models.},

However, in 138Cs the energy of this orbital should be increased compared to its energy in 133Sb, to get the best description, in contrast to 136I and 135Sb, where it had to be decreased. The best reproduction of excitation energies in 138Cs is obtained assuming that the $\pi$d 5/2 orbital in 138Cs is located about 100 keV higher than in 133Sb. These observations suggest that the lowering of the d 5/2 s.p. energy in 135Sb is not a physical effect due to the appearance of a neutron skin, as proposed by other authors, but rather an artifact due to some deficiency of the input data used in the shell model calculations in the region of the doubly magic 132Sn core.},

Pulsed beams with Gaussian radial profiles and diameters as small as 50$\mu$m are extracted from electron plasmas initially 2mm in diameter. A simple theory for the beam diameter predicts 4$\lambda$D (full width to 1∕e), where $\lambda$D is the Debye length, in good agreement with experimental measurements on electron plasmas. Applications and extensions of this technique to create bright, finely focused beams of positrons and other scarce particles are discussed.},

@phdthesis{Henderson2014a,
abstract = {The isospin dependence of the nuclear interaction was probed using energy differences between analogue excited states across the A=74 isobaric triplet. The first spectroscopy of transitions between states in the proton-dripline nuclide, 74Sr was performed using the highly-selective recoil-beta tagging technique with the JUROGAM II + RITU + GREAT setup at the University of Jyvaskyla. Considerable experimental development was required to acheive the requisite level of sensitivity. This included the development of a phosphor-sandwich detector, a finely segmented doublesided silicon-strip detector (DSSD) and a charged-particle veto array (UoYtube). The 2+ to 0+ and 4+ to 2+ transitions were identified through a combination of time and energy gates, and the implementation of a charged-particle veto. A beta-decay half-life was also extracted, in good agreement with a complementary measurement performed at RIKEN. Comparison with Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculations indicates that 74Sr is approximately 1-MeV less bound than previously supposed, implying that both observed excited states are two-proton unbound. Through comparison with published data from the A=74 isobar, triplet-energy differences (TEDs) were determined, indicating a continued need for an additional isotensor, J=0, 100-keV isospin-nonconserving (INC) interaction component, consistent with that found to be required at lower masses. The implication of this result is that such an INC component is mandated across the nuclear landscape, regardless of local nuclear structure effects. Additionally, candidates for the beta-delayed proton decay of 73Sr via 73Rb to 72Kr were observed using the same experimental setup. The lowest energy proton detected is consistent with that which might be expected for the decay of the ground state in 73Rb, allowing for the first measurement of the proton separation energy, Sp. This value is of considerable astrophysical interest since 73Rb is considered to be a waiting point in the rp process.},

Masses are one of the most important nuclear physics ingredients that go into calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis as they enter into the calculations of reaction rates, decay rates, branching ratios and Q-values. We explore the impact of uncertainties in three nuclear mass models on r-process abundances by performing global monte carlo simulations. We showthat root-mean-square (rms) errors of current mass models are large so that current r-process predictions are insufficient in predicting features found in solar residuals and in r-process enhanced metal poor stars. We conclude that the reduction of global rms errors below 100 keV will allow for more robust r-process predictions.},

An increased binding was predicted recently based on calculations that include three-nucleon (3N) forces.

The density is well below the Brillouin limit and varies with radius, as does the rotational angular velocity.

A single m=1 mode is found that is downshifted from the cyclotron frequency by an amount equal to the m=1 diocotron frequency. For each of the higher m values, bands of closely spaced discrete modes are found which are upshifted from the cyclotron frequency by the Doppler effect of rotation. The bands of discrete modes are explained as radially trapped azimuthally propagating Bernstein modes in a rotating plasma and approximate theories for these modes are outlined. By comparing the results with experiments, plasma parameters such as the ratio of Larmor radius to plasma scale length, the central rotation frequency, and the ratio of peak to average density can be inferred.},

abstract = {The r-process in a low-temperature environment is explored, in which the neutron emission by photodisintegration does not play a role (cold r-process). A semianalytic neutrino-driven wind model is utilized for this purpose. The temperature in a supersonically expanding outflow can quickly drop to a few 108 K, where the (n,$\gamma$)-($\gamma$,n) equilibrium is never achieved during the heavy r-nuclei synthesis. In addition, the neutron capture competes with the $\beta$-decay owing to the low matter density. Despite such nonstandard physical conditions for the cold r-process, a solar-like r-process abundance curve can be reproduced. The cold r-process predicts, however, low lead production compared to that expected in the traditional r-process conditions, which can be a possible explanation for the low lead abundances found in a couple of r-process-rich Galactic halo stars.},

This matter constitutes the site of the vp‐process where antineutrino absorption reactions catalyze the nucleosynthesis of nuclei with A{\textgreater}64. At later times, the ejected matter becomes neutron‐rich and might be the site for the r‐process. The sensitivity of the r‐process to the nuclear physics input is discussed.},

The results for Ni57,60,64−69 (Z=28), Cu65−74,76 (Z=29), and Ga63−65,68−78 (Z=31) have a relative uncertainty of the order of 10−8. In particular, the mass of Cu76 was measured for the first time. We analyze the resulting mass surface for signs of magicity, comparing the behavior of N=40 with that of known magic numbers and with midshell behavior. While the classic indications from the mass surface show no evidence for a shell closure at N=40, there is evidence for a weak—and very localized—effect for Z=28, consistent with findings from nuclear spectroscopy studies.},

@article{Hilsabeck2001,
abstract = {Diocotron modes are discussed for a finite length nonneutral plasma column under the assumption of bounce averaged E×B drift dynamics and small Debye length. In this regime, which is common to experiments, Debye shielding forces the mode potential to be constant along field lines within the plasma (i.e., ∂$\delta$$\phi$/∂z=0). One can think of the plasma as a collection of magnetic-field aligned rods that undergo E×B drift across the field and adjust their length so as to maintain the condition ∂$\delta$$\phi$/∂z=0 inside the plasma. Using the Green function (for a region bounded by a conducting cylinder) to relate the perturbed charge density and the perturbed potential, imposing the constraint ∂$\delta$$\phi$/∂z=0, and discretizing yields a matrix eigenvalue problem. The mode eigenvector$\delta$Nl,$\omega$(rj)≡∫dz $\delta$nl,$\omega$(rj,z) is the lth azimuthal Fourier component of the z-integrated density perturbation, and the frequency $\omega$ is the eigenvalue. The solutions include the full continuum and discrete stable and unstable diocotron modes. Finite column length introduces a new set of discrete diocotron-like modes. Also, finite column length makes possible the exponential growth of l=1diocotron modes, long observed in experiments. The paper focuses on these two problems. To approach quantitative agreement with experiment for the l=1 instabilities, the model is extended to include the dependence of a particle's bounce averaged rotation frequency on its axial energy. For certain distributions of axial energies, this dependence can substantially affect the instability.},

abstract = {The transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission as dependent on the excitation energy and nucleon composition of fissioning Th and Pa nuclei is investigated for the 232Th(n, F) and 232Th(p, F) reactions, respectively. Observed neutron-induced fission cross sections are described in a fission/evaporation approximation. A separate relatively high outer fission barrier View the MathML sourceEfBSL with significant curvature was assumed for the symmetric mode, while the inner one (View the MathML sourceEfASL(AS)) was assumed to be the same for symmetric (SL)(SL) and asymmetric (AS)(AS) modes. Axial asymmetry and mass symmetry is assumed for the outer saddle of the SL-mode, as distinct from the AS -mode. A drop of View the MathML source(EfASL−EfAAS)=3.5 MeV to ∼1–1.5 MeV for Th and Pa nuclei with A⩽226A⩽226 is responsible for the increase of the symmetric fission contribution to 225,229,230,231,232Th(n, F) or 232Th(p, F) fission cross sections with nucleon energy up to En(p)=200 MeVEn(p)=200 MeV. It is shown that with increase of the En(p)En(p) above ∼80 MeV∼80 MeV the 229,230,231,232Th(n, F) fission cross sections are no longer dependent on the Th target nuclide fissility. The dependence of 232Th fission cross section on the incident particle (n or p) is predicted to be different than in case of 238U target nuclide.},

abstract = {The main purpose of the present manuscript is to review the structural evolution along the isotonic and isotopic chains around the "traditional" magic numbers 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126. The exotic regions of the chart of nuclides have been explored during the last three decades. Then the postulate of permanent magic numbers was definitely abandoned and the reason for these structural mutations has been in turn searched for. General trends in the evolution of shell closures are discussed using complementary experimental information, such as the binding energies of the orbits bounding the shell gaps, the trends of the first collective states of the even-even semi-magic nuclei, and the behavior of certain single-nucleon states. Each section is devoted to a particular magic number. It describes the underlying physics of the shell evolution which is not yet fully understood and indicates future experimental and theoretical challenges. The nuclear mean field embodies various facets of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, among which the spin-orbit and tensor terms play decisive roles in the shell evolutions. The present review intends to provide experimental constraints to be used for the refinement of theoretical models aiming at a good description of the existing atomic nuclei and at more accurate predictions of hitherto unreachable systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper is the first of two parts presenting the result of a new evaluation of atomic masses (Image 2003). In this first part we give full information on the used and rejected input data and on the procedures used in deriving the tables in the second part. We first describe the philosophy and procedures used in selecting nuclear-reaction, decay, and mass spectrometric results as input values in a least-squares evaluation of best values for atomic masses. The calculation procedures and particularities of the Image are then described. All accepted data, and rejected ones with a reported precision still of interest, are presented in a table and compared there with the adjusted values. The differences with the earlier evaluation are briefly discussed and information is given of interest for the users of this Image . The second paper for the Image 2003, last in this issue, gives a table of atomic masses, tables and graphs of derived quantities, and the list of references used in both this evaluation and the Image 2003 table (first paper in this issue).},

The masses of (82,83)Ga, (83-85)Ge, (84-87)As, and 89Se were measured for the first time. These new data represent a major improvement in the knowledge of the masses in this neutron-rich region. Two-neutron separation energies provide evidence for the reduction of the N=50 shell gap energy towards germanium (Z=32) and a subsequent increase at gallium (Z=31). The data are compared with a number of theoretical models. An indication of the persistent rigidity of the shell gap towards nickel (Z=28) is obtained.},

A second $\beta$--fed 1+ level was identified in 132Sb; it lies at an energy of 2268 keV and is fed by a relatively strong 0.83{\%} $\beta$--decay branch. Four $\gamma$ rays were identified that form a weakly populated cascade from a level at 483 keV. Coincidence data demonstrate that the 254-keV level in this cascade is the 102-ns isomer identified previously by Clark et al. A 96-keV, isomeric $\gamma$ ray has been assigned to the decay of the 4.1-min, 8- isomer in 132Sb. It may also be the 96-keV transition that is associated with the 1.8-$\mu$s isomer identified in the A=132 chain by Clark et al. The splitting of the levels in the proton-neutron multiplets is discussed and compared with the results of several recent shell-model calculations.},

The corresponding mean square charge-radii changes, from the 1/2+ and the 3/2+ ground states to the 11/2− isomers, have been found to follow a distinct parabolic dependence as a function of the atomic mass number. Since the isomers have been previously associated with simplicity due to the linear mass dependence of their quadrupole moments, the regularity of the isomer shifts suggests a higher order of symmetry affecting the ground states in addition. A comprehensive description assuming nuclear deformation is found to accurately reproduce the radii differences in conjunction with the known quadrupole moments. This intuitive interpretation is supported by covariant density functional theory.},

abstract = {We present a nucleus-dependent valence-space approach for calculating ground and excited states of nuclei, which generalizes the shell-model in-medium similarity renormalization group to an ensemble reference with fractionally filled orbitals. Because the ensemble is used only as a reference, and not to represent physical states, no symmetry restoration is required. This allows us to capture three-nucleon (3N) forces among valence nucleons with a valence-space Hamiltonian specifically targeted to each nucleus of interest. Predicted ground-state energies from carbon through nickel agree with results of other large-space ab initio methods, generally to the 1{\%} level. In addition, we show that this new approach is required in order to obtain convergence for nuclei in the upper p and sd shells. Finally, we address the 1 þ =3 þ inversion problem in 22 Na and 46 V. This approach extends the reach of ab initio nuclear structure calculations to essentially all light-and medium-mass nuclei. The development of a first-principles, or ab initio, theo-retical description of atomic nuclei is a central challenge in nuclear physics. This task is complicated by the combined difficulties of not having an exact form for nuclear interactions and the great complexity in solving the nuclear many-body problem. Regardless, controlled predictions with uncertainty estimates are vital to guide efforts of rare-isotope beam facilities [1,2], to constrain nucleosynthesis models predicting the origin of heavy elements in the Universe [3,4], and to quantify nuclear structure effects in searches for beyond-standard-model physics such as neutrinoless dou-ble-beta decay [5], dark matter [6,7], and superallowed beta decay [8]. Developments in chiral effective field theory [9,10], similarity renormalization group (SRG) [11], and ab initio many-body techniques [12–17] provide a unified picture for these efforts, while three-nucleon (3N) forces have emerged as an essential component of nuclear forces [2,18–29]. In this Letter, we present a powerful many-body development which significantly extends the range of systems in which nuclear forces may be tested. One promising approach to the many-body problem is offered by the shell-model paradigm, where a valence-space Hamiltonian of tractable dimension is decoupled from the much larger Hilbert space and diagonalized. This allows the treatment of excited states, deformation, and transitions in open-shell systems within a single framework. Building upon earlier perturbative approaches [30–32], ab initio methods now provide shell-model Hamiltonians in a non-perturbative manner [33–39], similar to recent work for chemical systems, see, e.g., Ref. [40]. However, the inclu-sion of residual 3N forces [41] among valence particles [42,43] remains problematic in nonperturbative methods and leads to a loss in accuracy compared to large-space ab initio calculations [38]. A first attempt to address this shortcoming within the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG) frame-work [38] used normal ordering with respect to closed subshells in the valence space, but gave no clear prescrip-tion for systems far from closed shells. In this Letter, we generalize our approach to a reference with fractionally occupied orbits, capturing the dominant effects of neglected 3N forces among valence nucleons. Since these effects scale nontrivially with mass number A, the standard shell-model approach of constructing one Hamiltonian for an entire region [44,45] appears to be insufficient from an ab initio standpoint. Therefore, we adopt a new strategy and decouple a targeted valence-space Hamiltonian for each nucleus with the IM-SRG, using a specialized reference for the normal ordering. The resulting ground-state energies agree well with large-space ab initio meth-ods, generally to the 1{\%} level. We highlight the improve-ment for systems far from closed shells in 22 Na and 46 V, where the 1},

@article{Steppenbeck2013,
abstract = {Atomic nuclei are finite quantum systems composed of two distinct types of fermion--protons and neutrons. In a manner similar to that of electrons orbiting in an atom, protons and neutrons in a nucleus form shell structures. In the case of stable, naturally occurring nuclei, large energy gaps exist between shells that fill completely when the proton or neutron number is equal to 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 or 126 (ref. 1). Away from stability, however, these so-called 'magic numbers' are known to evolve in systems with a large imbalance of protons and neutrons. Although some of the standard shell closures can disappear, new ones are known to appear. Studies aiming to identify and understand such behaviour are of major importance in the field of experimental and theoretical nuclear physics. Here we report a spectroscopic study of the neutron-rich nucleus (54)Ca (a bound system composed of 20 protons and 34 neutrons) using proton knockout reactions involving fast radioactive projectiles. The results highlight the doubly magic nature of (54)Ca and provide direct experimental evidence for the onset of a sizable subshell closure at neutron number 34 in isotopes far from stability.},

In the relativistic mean-field model, the calculation with the PC-PK1 has improved significantly in describing masses compared to the TMA, especially for the neutron-deficient nuclei. The corresponding rms deviation with respect to the known masses falls to 1.4 MeV. Furthermore, it is found that the RMF mass model better describes the nuclei with large deformations. The rms deviation for nuclei with the absolute value of quadrupole deformation parameter greater than 0.25 falls to 0.93, crossing the 1 MeV accuracy threshold for the PC-PK1, which may indicate the new model is more suitable for those largely-deformed nuclei. In addition, the necessity of new high-precision experimental data to evaluate and develop the nuclear mass models is emphasized as well.},

abstract = {We present a new effective interaction for shell-model calculations in the model space consisting of the single-particle orbits 1p3/2, 0f5/2, 1p1/2, and 0g9/2. Starting with a realistic interaction based on the Bonn-C potential, 133 two-body matrix elements and four single-particle energies are modified empirically so as to fit 400 experimental energy data out of 69 nuclei with mass numbers A=63{\~{}}96. The systematics of binding energies, electromagnetic moments and transitions, and low-lying energy levels are described. The soft Z=28 closed core is observed, in contrast to the stable N=50 shell closure. The new interaction is applied to systematic studies of three different chains of nuclei, Ge isotopes around N=40, N=Z nuclei with A=64{\~{}}70, and N=49 odd-odd nuclei, focusing especially on the role of the g9/2 orbit. The irregular behavior of the 0+2 state in Ge isotopes is understood as a result of detailed balance between the N=40 single-particle energy gap and the collective effects. The development of the band structure in N=Z nuclei is interpreted in terms of successive excitations of nucleons into the g9/2 orbit. The triaxial/$\gamma$-soft structure in Ge64 and the prolate/oblate shape coexistence in Se68 are predicted, showing a good correspondence with the experimental data. The isomeric states in As66 and Br70 are obtained with the structure of an aligned proton-neutron pair in the g9/2 orbit. Low-lying energy levels in N=49 odd-odd nuclei can be classified as proton-neutron pair multiplets, implying that the obtained single-particle structure in this neutron-rich region appears to be appropriate. These results demonstrate that, in spite of the modest model space, the new interaction turns out to describe rather well properties related to the g9/2 orbit in various cases, including moderately deformed nuclei.},

The primary objective for such a device is the measurement of the weak electron-capture branching ratios of the odd-odd intermediate nuclei in double-beta decay. Those ratios will provide experimental input to benchmark theoretical shell-model calculations for the nuclear matrix elements in double-beta decay. The setup is part of the TITAN (TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science) facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. The apparatus employs an open-access electron-beam ion trap to provide a low-background environment as well as backing-free ion storage, and is surrounded radially by seven low-energy planar silicon-lithium drifted photon detectors. Employing an electron beam for charge breeding optimizes the ion-cloud confinement and increases the ion storage time in the trap, thereby allowing half-life measurements.},

abstract = {The r-process, or the rapid neutron-capture process, of stellar nucleosynthesis is called for to explain the production of the stable (and some long-lived radioactive) neutron-rich nuclides heavier than iron that are observed in stars of various metallicities, as well as in the solar system. A very large amount of nuclear information is necessary in order to model the r-process. This concerns the static characteristics of a large variety of light to heavy nuclei between the valley of stability and the vicinity of the neutron-drip line, as well as their beta-decay branches or their reactivity. Fission probabilities of very neutron-rich actinides have also to be known in order to determine the most massive nuclei that have a chance to be involved in the r-process. Even the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter may enter the problem. The enormously challenging experimental and theoretical task imposed by all these requirements is reviewed, and the state-of-the-art development in the field is presented. Nuclear-physics-based and astrophysics-free r-process models of different levels of sophistication have been constructed over the years. We review their merits and their shortcomings. The ultimate goal of r-process studies is clearly to identify realistic sites for the development of the r-process. Here too, the challenge is enormous, and the solution still eludes us. For long, the core collapse supernova of massive stars has been envisioned as the privileged r-process location. We present a brief summary of the one- or multidimensional spherical or non-spherical explosion simulations available to-date. Their predictions are confronted with the requirements imposed to obtain an r-process. The possibility of r-nuclide synthesis during the decompression of the matter of neutron stars following their merging is also discussed. Given the uncertainties remaining on the astrophysical r-process site and on the involved nuclear physics, any confrontation between predicted r-process yields and observed abundances is clearly risky. A comparison dealing with observed r-nuclide abundances in very metal-poor stars and in the solar system is attempted on grounds of r-process models based on parametrised astrophysics conditions. The virtues of the r-process product actinides for dating old stars or the solar system are also critically reviewed.},

abstract = {Stored waveform excitation produced by inverse Fourier transformation of a specified magnitude/phase excitation spectrum offers the most general and versatile means for broadband mass-selective excitation and ejection in Penning (FT-ICR) and Paul (quadrupole) ion trap mass spectrometry. Since the last comprehensive review of SWIFT excitation in 1987, the technique has been adopted, modified, and extended widely in both the ICR and quadrupole ion trap communities. Here, we review the principles, variations, algorithms, hardware implementation, and some applications of SWIFT for both ICR and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry. We show that the most desirable SWIFT waveform is that optimized to reduce both the time-domain SWIFT maximum amplitude and the amplitude near the start and end of the SWIFT waveform. We examine the “true” magnitude excitation spectrum, obtained by zero-filling and forward Fourier transforming the SWIFT time-domain waveform, in order to evaluate the trade-off between spectral magnitude uniformity and frequency (mass) selectivity. Apodization of the SWIFT waveform is optimally conducted by smoothing the excitation magnitude spectrum prior to generation of the SWIFT waveform by inverse FT. When (as for broadband ejection in a quadrupole ion trap) it is important that ions be excited near-simultaneously over a wide mass range, the phase spectrum (before inverse FT to generate the SWIFT waveform) may be overmodulated or randomly modulated (“filtered noise field”), with the recognition that very substantial non-uniformity in the “true” excitation magnitude spectrum will result.},

Four types of particle-hole bands built on the known 334.3 keV isomer in 133Te are identified. The yrast and near yrast particle-hole states observed up to 6.2 MeV in 133Te have characteristics quite similar to those in 134Te. These states are interpreted as a result of coupling a neutron $\nu$h11/2 hole to the 134Te core. The group of states observed above 5.214 MeV is the result of a neutron particle-hole excitation of the double magic core nucleus 132Sn, and is a candidate for a tilted rotor band. Shell-model calculations considering 132Sn as a closed core have been performed and have provided guidance to the interpretation of the levels below 4.3 MeV. Very good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for these states.},

In addition to excellent ion confinement and storage, the EBIT also provides a venue for performing decay spectroscopy on highly charged radioactive ions. Recent technical advancements have been able to provide a significant increase in sensitivity for low-energy photon detection, towards the goal of measuring weak electron-capture branching ratios of the intermediate nuclei in the two-neutrino double beta (2$\nu$$\beta$$\beta$) decay process.

The various parameters of the Paul trap and the Penning trap have been optimized, and first mass measurements of gold and platinum isotopes were conducted with the CPT mass spectrometer. A resolving power of 1.2 * 106 and an accuracy of 2 * 10 -8 are attained},

abstract = {Type I X-ray bursts are violent stellar events that take place in the H/He-rich envelopes of accreting neutron stars. We have investigated the role played by uncertainties in nuclear processes on the nucleosynthesis accompanying these explosive phenomena. Two different approaches have been adopted, in the framework of postprocessing calculations. In the first one, nuclear rates are varied individually within uncertainties. Ten different models, covering the characteristic parameter space for these stellar events, have been considered. The second, somewhat complementary approach involves a Monte Carlo code in which all nuclear rates are randomly varied within uncertainty limits simultaneously. All in all, about 50,000 postprocessing calculations, with a network containing 606 nuclides (H to 113 Xe) and more than 3500 nuclear processes, have been performed in this work. A brief comparison between both procedures is outlined together with an overall account of the key nuclear reactions whose uncertainties have the largest impact in our X-ray burst nucleosynthesis studies.},

abstract = {Precision mass measurements of short-lived isotopes provide insight into a wide array of physics, including nuclear structure, nucleosynthesis, and tests of the Standard Model. The precision of Penning trap mass spectrometry (PTMS) measurements is limited by the lifetime of the isotopes of interest, but scales proportionally with their charge state q, making highly charged ions attractive for mass measurements of nuclides far from stability. TITAN, TRIUMF's Ion Trap(s) for Atomic and Nuclear science, is currently the only setup in the world coupling an EBIT to a rare isotope facility for the purpose of PTMS. Charge breeding ions for Penning trap mass spectrometry, however, entails specific set of challenges. To make use of its potential, efficiencies have to be high, breeding times have to be short and the ion energy spread has to be small. An overview of the TITAN facility and charge-breeding program is given, current and future developments are highlighted and some selected results are presented.},

@article{Wanajo2006,
abstract = {Recent hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae with accurate neutrino transport suggest that the bulk of the early neutrino-heated ejecta is proton rich, in which the production of some interesting proton-rich nuclei is expected. As suggested in recent nucleosynthesis studies, the rapid proton-capture (rp) process takes place in such proton-rich environments by bypassing the waiting point nuclei with the beta-lives of a few minutes via the faster capture of neutrons continuously supplied from the neutrino absorption by protons. In this study, the nucleosynthesis calculations are performed with the wide ranges of the neutrino luminosities and the electron fractions (Ye), using the semi-analytic models of proto-neutron star winds. The masses of proto-neutron stars are taken to be 1.4 Msolar and 2.0 Msolar, where the latter is regarded as the test for somewhat high entropy winds (about a factor of two). For Ye {\textgreater} 0.52, the neutrino-induced rp-process takes place in many wind trajectories, and the p-nuclei up to A {\~{}} 130 are synthesized with interesting amounts. However, 92Mo is somewhat underproduced compared to those with similar mass numbers. For 0.46 {\textless} Ye {\textless} 0.49, on the other hand, 92Mo is significantly enhanced by the nuclear flows in the vicinity of the abundant 90Zr that originates from the alpha-process at higher temperature. The nucleosynthetic yields are averaged over the ejected masses of winds, and further the Ye distribution predicted by the recent hydrodynamic simulation of a core-collapse supernova. Comparison of the mass-Ye-averaged yields to the solar compositions implies that the neutrino-driven winds can be potentially the origin of light p-nuclei up to A {\~{}} 110, including 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru that cannot be explained by other astrophysical sites.},

abstract = {The astrophysical rapid neutron capture process or 'r process' of nucleosynthesis is believed to be responsible for the production of approximately half the heavy element abundances found in nature. This multifaceted problem remains one of the greatest open challenges in all of physics. Knowledge of nuclear physics properties such as masses, ??-decay and neutron capture rates, as well as ??-delayed neutron emission probabilities are critical inputs that go into calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis. While properties of nuclei near stability have been established, much still remains unknown regarding neutron-rich nuclei far from stability that may participate in the r process. Sensitivity studies gauge the astrophysical response of a change in nuclear physics input(s) which allows for the isolation of the most important nuclear properties that shape the final abundances observed in nature. This review summarizes the extent of recent sensitivity studies and highlights how these studies play a key role in facilitating new insight into the r process. The development of these tools promotes a focused effort for state-of-the-art measurements, motivates construction of new facilities and will ultimately move the community toward addressing the grand challenge of 'How were the elements from iron to uranium made?'.},

abstract = {We present a new nucleosynthesis process that we denote as the $\nu$p process, which occurs in supernovae (and possibly gamma-ray bursts) when strong neutrino fluxes create proton-rich ejecta. In this process, antineutrino absorptions in the proton-rich environment produce neutrons that are immediately captured by neutron-deficient nuclei. This allows for the nucleosynthesis of nuclei with mass numbers A{\textgreater}64, making this process a possible candidate to explain the origin of the solar abundances of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru. This process also offers a natural explanation for the large abundance of Sr seen in a hyper-metal-poor star.},

abstract = {The mass of the nucleus, through its binding energy, continues to be of capital importance not only for various aspects of nuclear physics, but also for other branches of physics, notably weak-interaction studies and astrophysics. The authors first describe the modern experimental techniques dedicated to the particularly challenging task of measuring the mass of exotic nuclides and make detailed comparisons. Though tremendous progress in these and the associated production techniques has been made, allowing access to nuclides very far from stability, it is still not yet possible to produce many nuclides involved in stellar nucleosynthesis, especially the r process, leaving no choice but to resort to theory. The review thus goes on to describe and critically compare the various modern mass formulas that may be used to extrapolate from the data towards the neutron drip line. Special attention is devoted to the crucial interplay between theory and experiment, showing how new measurements far from stability can considerably reduce the ambiguity in extrapolations to nuclides even further away.},

abstract = {In this Letter, we introduce the concept of in-trap nuclear decay spectroscopy of highly charged radioactive ions and describe its successful application as a novel spectroscopic tool. This is demonstrated by a measurement of the decay properties of radioactive mass A=124 ions (here, In124 and Cs124) in the electron-beam ion trap of the TITAN facility at TRIUMF. By subjecting the trapped ions to an intense electron beam, the ions are charge bred to high charge states (i.e., equivalent to the removal of N-shell electrons), and an increase of storage times to the level of minutes without significant ion losses is achieved. The present technique opens the venue for precision spectroscopy of low branching ratios and is being developed in the context of measuring electron-capture branching ratios needed for determining the nuclear ground-state properties of the intermediate odd-odd nuclei in double-beta ($\beta$$\beta$) decay.},

This effect is re-evaluated using the ground-state contributions to the stellar reaction rates, which were shown to be better suited to judge the importance of excited state contributions than the previously applied SEFs. An update of the tables shown in Phys. Rev. C 80, 035801 (2009) is given. The new evalution finds 2350 cases (out of a full set of 57513 reactions) for which the ground-state contribution is larger in the reaction direction with negative reaction Q-value than in the exothermic direction, thus providing exceptions to the commonly applied Q-value rule. The results confirm the Coulomb suppression effect but lead to a larger number of exceptions than previously found. This is due to the fact that often a large variation in the g.s. contribution does not lead to a sizeable change in the SEF. On the other hand, several previously identified cases do not appear anymore because it is found that their g.s. contribution is smaller than inferred from the SEF.},

abstract = {The structure of self-conjugate odd-odd N = Z nucleus 66As has been ex- perimentally studied in detail. Prompt and isomeric excited states have been observed utilising recoil-$\beta$ tagging and recoil-isomer taggingmethods. Most im- portantly, candidates for the excited states in the T = 1 band were identified up to spin J$\pi$ = 6+. Three new detectors i.e., a charged-particle veto detector, a highly-pixelated DSSD and a phosphor sandwich device have been constructed and tested to enhance the sensitivity of the recoil-$\beta$ tagging approach. The newly developed charged-particle veto detector in conjunction with the recoil-$\beta$ tagging allowed excited states in the exotic neutron-deficient N =Z −2 nucleus 66Se to be identified up to spin J$\pi$ = 6+. The newly obtained spectroscopic results both in 66As and 66Se permitted the derivation of energy differences between isobaric analogue states in the full A = 66 triplet. These results show that both the charge-symmetry and charge-independence characteristics of the strong nucleon-nucleon interaction are violated. Moreover, the experimental energy differences are larger than predicted by the shell-model calculations. This points towards a need for an additional isospin non-conserving interac- tion, whose fundamental origin cannot be explained on the basis of existing nuclear models},

abstract = {We discuss implications of recent precision measurements for the Rh93 proton separation energy for the production of the lightest molybdenum isotopes in proton-rich type II supernova ejecta. It has recently been shown that a novel neutrino-induced process makes these ejecta a promising site for the production of the light molybdenum isotopes and other "p-nuclei" with atomic mass near 100. The origin of these isotopes has long been uncertain. A distinguishing feature of nucleosynthesis in neutrino-irradiated outflows is that the relative production of Mo92 and Mo94 is set by a competition governed by the proton separation energy of Rh93. We use detailed nuclear network calculations and the recent experimental results for this proton separation energy to place constraints on the outflow characteristics that produce the lightest molybdenum isotopes in their solar proportions. It is found that for the conditions calculated in recent two-dimensional supernova simulations, and also for a large range of outflow characteristics around these conditions, the solar ratio of Mo92 to Mo94 cannot be achieved. This suggests that either proton-rich winds from type II supernova do not exclusively produce both isotopes, or that these winds are qualitatively different than calculated in today's supernova models.},

The implications for the proton drip line and the astrophysical rp process are discussed. This is done within the framework of a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of rp process calculations in type I x-ray burst models on nuclear masses. We find that the remaining mass uncertainties, in particular for some nuclei with N=Z, still lead to large uncertainties in calculations of x-ray burst light curves. Further experimental or theoretical improvements of nuclear mass data are necessary before observed x-ray burst light curves can be used to obtain quantitative constraints on ignition conditions and neutron star properties. We identify a list of nuclei for which improved mass data would be most important.},

abstract = {Nuclear Astrophysics is concerned with the study of nuclear processes at stellar temperature and density conditions. A main goal is the understanding of the synthesis of the elements and the generation of energy guiding stellar evolution and driving stellar explosions. Observables (like e.g. luminosity curves or elemental abundance distributions) witness the interplay between nuclear structure aspects near the particle drip-lines and the appropriate astrophysical environments, and give guidance to and constraints on stellar conditions and the associated nucleosynthesis. We present an overview of the broad range of nucleosynthesis scenarios from the Big Bang to the different conditions during stellar evolution and stellar explosion. Special emphasis is given to the discussion of nuclear physics aspects of pre-supernova collapse and supernova shock front nucleosynthesis. Of great interests are presently nucleosynthesis processes far from the limits of stability like the neutron diriven r -process and the hydrogen driven rp -process. The nuclear physics of the r -process and the possible site for the r -process in the neutrino driven wind of the supernova shock are discussed and the possible impact of neutrino induced processes is presented. Hydrogen induced explosive processes occur in the thermonuclear runaway on the surface of accreting compact stars at electron degenerate conditions. This includes novae triggered by accretion on white dwarfs and x-ray bursts initiated by accretion on neutron stars. High accretion rates on white dwarfs and neutron stars lead to supernova type Ia explosions or to x-ray pulsars respectively. An overview of the nucleosynthesis conditions and uncertainties is given for all of these scenarios.},

abstract = {The shell structure of atomic nuclei is associated with 'magic numbers' and originates in the nearly independent motion of neutrons and protons in a mean potential generated by all nucleons. During $\beta$(+)-decay, a proton transforms into a neutron in a previously not fully occupied orbital, emitting a positron-neutrino pair with either parallel or antiparallel spins, in a Gamow-Teller or Fermi transition, respectively. The transition probability, or strength, of a Gamow-Teller transition depends sensitively on the underlying shell structure and is usually distributed among many states in the neighbouring nucleus. Here we report measurements of the half-life and decay energy for the decay of (100)Sn, the heaviest doubly magic nucleus with equal numbers of protons and neutrons. In the $\beta$-decay of (100)Sn, a large fraction of the strength is observable because of the large decay energy. We determine the largest Gamow-Teller strength so far measured in allowed nuclear $\beta$-decay, establishing the 'superallowed' nature of this Gamow-Teller transition. The large strength and the low-energy states in the daughter nucleus, (100)In, are well reproduced by modern, large-scale shell model calculations.},

The r process is thought to be responsible for the creation of more than half of all elements beyond iron. The scientific challenges to understanding the origin of the heavy elements beyond iron lie in both the uncertainties associated with astrophysical conditions that are needed to allow an r process to occur and a vast lack of knowledge about the properties of nuclei far from stability. One way is to disentangle the nuclear and astrophysical components of the question. On the nuclear physics side, there is great global competition to access and measure the most exotic nuclei that existing facilities can reach, while simultaneously building new, more powerful accelerators to make even more exotic nuclei. On the astrophysics side, various astrophysical scenarios for the production of the heaviest elements have been proposed but open questions remain. This paper reports on a sensitivity study of the r process to determine the most crucial nuclear masses to measure using an r-process simulation code, several mass models (FRDM, Duflo-Zuker, and HFB-21), and three potential astrophysical scenarios.},

The final abundances of these two isotopes as well as any others synthesized by the $\nu$ p -process depend directly on the values of the proton separation energies, S p , along the $\nu$ p -process reaction path; the S p value of 93 Rh is thought to be especially critical to the relative production of 92 Mo and 94 Mo [ 2 ]. Due to the absence of mass measurements in this region S p ( 93 Rh) and many of the other required S p values were not well known. Recent mass measurements performed with the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer have reduced uncertainties in the S p values of many of the proton-rich nuclei between Mo and Pd including S p ( 93 Rh) by factors of as much as 60. These measurements and the resulting implications for both the $\nu$ p -process path and the 92 Mo/ 94 Mo abundance ratio will be discussed.},

abstract = {We present the first ab initio calculations of nuclear ground states up into the domain of heavy nuclei, spanning the range from 16O to 132Sn, based on two- plus three-nucleon interactions derived within chiral effective field theory. We employ the similarity renormalization group for preparing the Hamiltonian and use coupled-cluster theory to solve the many-body problem for nuclei with closed sub-shells. Through an analysis of theoretical uncertainties resulting from various truncations in this framework, we identify and eliminate the technical hurdles that previously inhibited the step beyond medium-mass nuclei, allowing for reliable validations of nuclear Hamiltonians in the heavy regime. Following this path we show that chiral Hamiltonians qualitatively reproduce the systematics of nuclear ground-state energies up to the neutron-rich Sn isotopes. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {A new 10 GHz electron cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS) has been constructed and commissioned for the ATLAS accelerator. This new source replaces the original ATLAS ECRIS that has been in operations since 1987. The goal of this upgrade project was to significantly improve the source performance while maintaining maximum operational flexibility for solid material feeds. The new source design includes a large magnetic-field gradient, aluminum plasma chamber, and bias disk following modern ECRIS design concepts. Eight solenoid coils from the original source along with a new iron yoke form the magnetic mirror. Hall Probe measurements showed the axial B field to be within 1{\%} of the POISSON design model calculated at 400 A per coil. The injection and extraction mirror ratios are approximately 4.4 and 2.9, respectively, with a minimum field of 3.0 kG. A new aluminum plasma chamber houses the NdFeB hexapole magnets, which are encased in austenitic stainless steel to allow for direct water cooling. An open hexapole configuration provides six radial access ports, 1.7 cm×4.1 cm, to the plasma chamber for solid material feeds and vacuum pumping at an estimated rate of 20 l/s per radial port. Measurements of the hexapole field near the plasma chamber wall, 4 cm in radius, were within 13{\%} of the designed B field of 9.3 and 5.7 kG along the poles and pole gaps, respectively. The first plasma in the new source was obtained on October 10, 2000. Already it has exceeded the best 16O6+ beam current obtained from the original ECR-I by a factor of roughly 2.3, achieving 140 e $\mu$A with a biased disk. The source is back in regular operation and ATLAS experiment runs have been performed with He, O, Ar, Kr, Ni, and Zr.},

The mass of the superallowed beta emitter 38Ca contributes for testing the theoretical corrections of the conserved-vector-current hypothesis of the electroweak interaction.

abstract = {It has been suggested that a magnetically confined pure electron plasma might be cooled to the liquid and crystal states. Here, cyclotron radiation is considered as a possible cooling mechanism. The plasma and some cooled resisting medium are assumed to reside inside a conducting cavity. When the cyclotron motion of the electrons resonantly drives a cavity mode which is damped by the cooled medium, energy is transferred from the electrons to the medium. Attention is focused on the case where all of the electrons experience a sharp (i.e., high‐Q) resonance with a single cavity mode. An interesting result is that the rate of energy loss per electron can exceed, by a factor of Q, the radiation rate for an electron executing cyclotron motion in unbounded space. The maximum value of Q is limited by cyclotron damping of the mode on the plasma itself and can be large for a non‐neutral plasma at a density well below the Brillouin limit (i.e., for $\omega$ p {\textless}{\textless}$\Omega$, where $\omega$ p is the plasma frequency and $\Omega$ is the cyclotron frequency).},

Our mass excess value of 25 078.0(2.1) keV is in agreement with previous measurements, but is a factor of 7 more precise than the Atomic Mass Evaluation of 2003. To address an unresolved discussion on the spin assignment of isospin T=2 states in C12 and O12, we reevaluate the isobaric mass multiplet equation for the lowest lying T=2 multiplet in the A=12 system and use the extracted parameters to extrapolate from the known excited 2+ and 0+ states in Be12. Though this analysis favors the second known T=2 state in C12 to be 2+, 0+ cannot be excluded.},

The unstable mode is observed to grow exponentially over several decades, in contradiction to present 2 D fluid theory. This l=1 instability can dominate the evolution well into the nonlinear regime, resulting in cross-field transport to a stable, monotonically decreasing density profile. To the extent this process is described by 2D E×B drifts, it is isomorphic to the Kelvin-Helmholtz shear-flow instability of inviscid fluids.},

In particular, the mass of 124Ag was previously unknown. In addition, other masses that had to be inferred from Q values of nuclear decays and reactions have now been measured directly. The analysis includes various mass differences, namely the two-neutron separation energies, the applicability of the Garvey-Kelson relations, double differences of masses $\delta$Vpn, which give empirical proton-neutron interaction strengths, as well as a comparison with recent microscopic calculations.

abstract = {At low excitation energies a "constant nuclear temperature" representation of nuclear-level densities is used, and at high excitation energies the regular Fermi gas formula is adopted. A method is developed for determining the parameters of the Fermi gas formula by using both the pairing and the shell-correction energies found by Cameron and Elkin for their semiempirical atomic mass formula in its exponential form. This procedure determines level densities at neutron-binding-energy excitations subject to an average factor error of 1.8. Methods are also developed for determining the parameters for the lower-energy formula in such a way that it best fits the lower-energy levels and joins smoothly to the Fermi gas formula. Correlations of the resulting parameters with shell and pairing effects are found. A composite prescription is given for calculating level densities in nuclei for which no experimental information is known. Tables give level density parameters for a wide variety of nuclei for which some experimental information is known. Some of the derivations of the Fermi gas formula in the literature were found to be slightly incorrect, so new derivations are presented in Appendixes.},

abstract = {Baryon density inhomogeneities during big bang nucleosynthesis can result from a variety of possible causes (e.g., quantum chromodynamic and electroweak phase transitions; cosmic strings). We present here the consequences of such inhomogeneities with special emphasis on the production of heavy elements in a parameter study, varying the global baryon-to-photon ratio eta (which is related to the baryon density and the Hubble constant via eta10 = 64.94 Omegab(H0/50)2 and the length scale of the density inhomogeneities. The production of heavy elements beyond Fe can only occur in neutron-rich environments; thus, we limit our study to neutron-rich zones, originating from neutron diffusion into low-density regions. In this first calculation including elements heavier than Si, we prove an earlier hypothesis that under such conditions r-process elements can be produced, strongly enhanced by the process of fission cycling. Primordial r-process abundances are, however, very sensitive to the choice of eta. Significant amounts, comparable to or larger than the (permitted) floor of heavy-element abundances found in low-metallicity stars at the onset of galactic evolution, can only be obtained for values in excess of eta10 = 133 (i.e., Omegab(h50)2 = 2.0; e.g., Omegab = 1, H0 = 71, or Omegab = 0.5, H0 = 100) and large length scales of inhomogeneities, which minimize the back-diffusion of neutrons into proton-rich regions. Recent investigations analyzing the primordial abundances of light elements seem to set tighter limits, eta10 less than 26 to 39 (Omega b)(h50)2 less than 0.4 to 0.6, from He-4 and apparently considerably lower values based on Li, Be, and B. Under such conditions the predicted abundances of heavy elements are a factor of 105 or more below presently observable limits.},

abstract = {X-ray burst model predictions of light curves and final composition of the nuclear ashes are affected by uncertain nuclear physics. Nuclear masses play an important role. Significant progress has been made in measuring the masses of very neutron deficient rare isotopes along the path of the rapid proton capture process (rp-process) in X-ray bursts. This paper identifies the remaining nuclear mass uncertainties in X-ray burst models using a one zone model that takes into account the changes in temperature and density evolution caused by changes in the nuclear physics. Two types of bursts are investigated -a typical mixed H/He burst with a limited rp-process and an extreme mixed H/He burst with an extended rp-process. Only three remaining nuclear mass uncertainties affect the light curve predictions of a typical H/He burst, and only three additional masses affect the composition strongly. A larger number of mass uncertainties remains to be addressed for the extreme H/He burst. Mass uncertainties of better than 10 keV need to be achieved. For one of the identified masses, 27 P, we use the isobaric mass multiplet equation (IMME) to improve the mass uncertainty, obtaining an atomic mass excess of -716(7) keV. The results provide a roadmap for future experiments at advanced rare isotope beam facilities, where all the identified nuclides are expected to be within reach for precision mass measurements. 1. INTRODUCTION Type I X-ray bursts are frequently observed ther-monuclear explosions on the surface of neutron stars that accrete matter from a nearby companion star (Schatz {\&} Rehm 2006; Strohmayer {\&} Bildsten 2006; Lewin et al. 1993; Parikh et al. 2013). The bursts are powered by nuclear reaction sequences that transform accreted hydrogen and helium into heav-ier elements via the 3$\alpha$-reaction, which burns helium into carbon, the $\alpha$p-process, a sequence of proton captures and ($\alpha$,p) reactions, and the rapid proton capture process (rp-process), a sequence of proton captures and $\beta$ + -decays (Wallace {\&} Woosley 1981; van Wormer et al. 1994; Schatz et al. 1998; Schatz et al. 2001; Fisker et al. 2008; Woosley et al. 2004; Jos{\'{e}} et al. 2010). Nuclear data on neutron defi-cient rare isotopes are needed to predict burst light curves that can then be compared with observations to constrain system parameters and neutron star properties (Heger et al. 2007; Galloway et al. 2004; Zamfir et al. 2012). Nuclear data are also needed to calculate the composition of the burst ashes to predict possible composition specific spectral signa-tures (Weinberg et al. 2006;Barr{\`{i}} ere et al. 2015; Kajava et al. 2016), and to predict the composi-tion of the neutron star crust, which in turn influ-ences heat transport properties as well as strength and distribution of various deep nuclear heating and},

abstract = {This paper is the first of two articles (Part I and Part II) that presents the results of the new atomic mass evaluation, AME2016. It includes complete information on the experimental input data (also including unused and rejected ones), as well as details on the evaluation procedures used to derive the tables of recommended values given in the second part. This article describes the evaluation philosophy and procedures that were implemented in the selection of specific nuclear reaction, decay and mass-spectrometric results. These input values were entered in the least-squares adjustment for determining the best values for the atomic masses and their uncertainties. Details of the calculation and particularities of the AME are then described. All accepted and rejected data, including outweighted ones, are presented in a tabular format and compared with the adjusted values obtained using the least-squares fit analysis. Differences with the previous AME2012 evaluation are discussed and specific information is presented for several cases that may be of interest to AME users. The second AME2016 article gives a table with the recommended values of atomic masses, as well as tables and graphs of derived quantities, along with the list of references used in both the AME2016 and the NUBASE2016 evaluations (the first paper in this issue).},

abstract = {Precise measurements of the $\beta$-$\nu$ correlation coefficient, a$\alpha$$\nu$ , provide information on the presence of possible exotic couplings in the weak interaction. In the Gamow-Teller decay 8 Li[arrow right]8 Be8 +$\nu$ + $\beta$, 8 Be* [arrow right] $\alpha$ + $\alpha$, the large Q value and the $\beta$-$\alpha$-$\nu$ correlation combine to provide enhanced sensitivity to any potential tensor coupling. A measurement of the $\beta$-$\alpha$-$\nu$ correlation has been performed at Argonne National Laboratory using a linear Paul trap surrounded by double-sided silicon strip detectors, in which the kinematics of the decay can be fully determined. More than 2{\textperiodcentered}10 5 $\beta$-$\alpha$-$\alpha$ coincidences have been detected within the trap. The square of the amplitude of any tensor component CT relative to that of the dominant axial-vector component CA has been deduced by measuring the energy difference between coincident $\alpha$ particles correlated with the direction of the $\beta$'s, resulting in |CT /CA | 2 = 0.0018 ± 0.0071stat ± 0.0082syst (95.5{\%} confidence level), consistent with the standard model.},

abstract = {We are developing the detector system of C-SPECT-I, the first generation system of a dedicated Cardiac SPECT platform. For cost-effectiveness, we use medium size single-anode PMTs with NaI(Tl) detector modules to form the body-contouring shape of the C-SPECT detector arc. We have designed and evaluated a test detector module that includes two pixelated NaI(Tl) detector blocks in a common hermetic housing to model a section of the detector arc. Each block is 93×51×10 mm3. Each pixel is 2.75×2.75×10 mm3 with 3mm pitch. We applied black or white epoxy at the edges of the module to investigate the pixel separation and reduction of the edge effect. Seven 2” PMTs in hexagonal pattern in three columns (2-3-2) were used for decoding the pixels. Two PMT configurations were evaluated. Configuration 1: seven standard quantum efficiency (SQE) PMTs. Configuration 2: a mixed array of standard quantum efficiency and high quantum efficiency, HQE, (2HQE-3SQE-2HQE). The HQE/SQE mixed array results in a 14{\%} improvement on the global P/V comparing to that of the SQE array. Using HQE/SQE mixed array improves the average energy resolution from 11.3{\%} to 10.5{\%}. Then we used the mixed array for evaluating different epoxy treatment. Pixels are clearly resolved in the decoding maps except at the very transverse edges of the two blocks. The block with black epoxy treatment performs better in terms of pixel separation at the transverse and axial edges of the block. An average energy resolution of 10.5{\%} and 10.1{\%} was obtained in the blocks with black and white epoxy treatment, respectively.},
